The Maruti Ertiga is on sale in India at a price of between Rs. 7.44 - 10.90 lakhs (ex-Delhi).

What you'll like.
A 7-seater MPV at the price of a C segment sedan. Sub 10-lakh petrol variants are well-priced
Practical & spacious cabin, now with a usable 3rd row & larger boot
A peppy petrol, efficient diesel & convenient automatic on offer = take your pick
Car-like to drive and city-friendly size (unlike most other 7-seater MPVs)
Features such as that sweet head-unit, projector headlamps, cooled cup-holders & more
Dual airbags, ABS + EBD, Isofix anchors & parking sensors are standard. Automatic gets ESP too
Marutis excellent after-sales service, wide dealer network & fuss-free ownership experience

What you won't like.
Build, quality & refinement are strictly average for a million-rupee car
Diesel carries a whopping Rs ~1.9 lakh OTR premium over the petrol
Small 1.3L diesel is unimpressive at this price point. Lag is obvious with a full load of passengers
3rd-row isn't for everyone as the 2nd-row doesn't tumble forward, making ingress / egress tricky
4-speed Automatic feels old & outdated. Not available in the top variant either
Some missing features such as an auto-dimming IRVM and auto headlamps + wipers (expected at this price)
Waiting periods are already 3 months long for most variants

Exterior
In India, MPV = Toyota Innova and Maruti Ertiga. These are the only two which have enjoyed success, while others like the Renault Lodgy, Honda Mobilio, Tata Aria / Hexa, Mahindra Xylo etc either failed or saw limited success. The recently launched Mahindra Marazzo is the only other MPV that seems to have a shot at success. Interestingly though, all these 3 MPVs (Ertiga, Marazzo, Innova) are of different sizes & compete in different price segments. It's as if they are untouchable in their own segments. In no other car category of India do we see just one player garnering all the sales.
The Ertiga was launched back in 2012. It gave Maruti a new segment and diversity in its product line-up. The 1st-generation Ertiga was targeted at the urban buyer with a need for 3 rows of seats. The car was more of a 5+2 seater than a proper 7 seater. The pricing as well reflected that the Ertiga was a good alternative to a sedan, offering additional seats for the same money. Since launch, the MPV has sold 4.2 lakh copies in a span of just 6 years. Sales usually hovered around the ~5,000 units / month mark.
Just like the outgoing car was based on the Swift platform, the new Ertiga is based on the Heartect platform that underpins the new Swift, Dzire, Baleno & Ignis. Due to this new lightweight platform, the kerb weight of the car has actually gone down, despite the larger dimensions and a bigger 1.5-litre petrol engine. The kerb weight is 1,135 kg for the petrol Ertiga and 1,220 kg for the diesel variant.
The Ertiga has lighter sheet metal than other UVs. The MPV feels slightly better built than the Swift & Dzire due to the larger and heavier doors, but has that typical "Maruti" feel to it (we don't mean it in a good way). Don't even expect the solid "thud" here. Some panel gaps are inconsistent too. While the paint quality is acceptable, it's certainly not exceptional. The Ertiga's build is 'average' at best for a car costing a million bucks.
Maruti has used the naturally-aspirated, 1.5L K15B petrol engine from the Ciaz & retained the 1.3L from before (new 1.5L diesel coming soon). Both are equipped with the company's mild-hybrid system with an idling start / stop function. The petrol gets an additional lithium-ion battery under the front passenger's seat for improved fuel economy. Both power the front wheels via a 5-speed MT, and an ancient 4-speed AT is optional on the petrol.
The Ertiga comes with dual front airbags, front seatbelts with pre-tensioners and load limiters, Isofix child seat anchors, ABS + EBD with brake assist, front seatbelt reminder with buzzer, rear parking sensors and high speed warnings as standard. The automatic variants further get hill hold assist and ESP.
The Ertiga gets a neutral, inoffensive design. Features a large chrome grille (direct copy of the Kia Carnival) and projector headlamps. While we generally dislike the excessive usage of chrome, Maruti has managed to make it look good on this people mover.
The rear is a busy place with multiple kinks & creases, L-shaped tail-lights (direct copy of the CR-V,check out A4Anurag's photo here) and a subtle chrome strip.
Clean side profile. It is impossible to mistake it for any car other than the Ertiga, despite the enhanced length and revised 3rd-row area. The Ertiga gets a nice shoulder crease broken up by the chrome door handles. Don't miss the upward sloping rear window with a floating roof element and the large wraparound tail-lights. Wheels look a bit small for all that sheet metal, especially at the rear.
One of the best angles for the Ertiga. In such a vehicle, keeping the design clean and neutral is the key to satisfy most customers. The L, W & H figures are 4,395 mm, 1,735 mm and 1,690 mm - an increase of 99 mm, 40 mm and 5 mm respectively. The new Ertiga certainly has more presence than the outgoing car.
In comparison to the front 3-quarter view, the rear appears overdone IMHO. With almost all cars, we usually see a lot of action at the front, while the rear ends are simpler. With the Ertiga, it's the opposite.
Headlamps now come with a halogen projector low beam and a conventional high beam. The indicator sits at the innermost position and no, those are not daytime running lights. We wish Maruti had given it DRLs. Notice how the top & bottom chrome bits align with the grille.
With the low beam and indicator in action. The pilot lamp is housed within the high beam.
Simple foglamps are housed in a triangular area with a C-shaped black surround.
In all, there are 41 pieces of chrome on the grille!! Chrome Suzuki badge gets somewhat lost in all that bling. A thicker U-shaped chrome border is smartly placed at the bottom. This grille gives character to its face. The dual-tone bumper uses black bits to break the maroon monotony.
Sadly, no underbody protection has been provided for the engine. Notice the black oil filter peeking out. Easiest oil change on the planet!
Clam shell bonnet looks clean. We like the subtle character lines.
Wipers get a conventional design with 2 washer nozzles sitting in front. Nozzles are well-hidden and shoot out triple jets of water.
The spray action looks sad, but is actually sufficient. The wipers do a good job of covering most of the windshield and they perform silently.
See what I meant earlier? 3 varying panel gaps in one image.
Chrome door handles. Even the passenger's side gets a black request sensor. Keyhole only on the driver's side though.
Electrically-foldable ORVMs get integrated blinkers.
Just look at the size of that rear door! The B and C-pillars are blackened, while the D-pillar gets a floating roof design in piano black. The glass area on the Ertiga is massive.
15" multi-spoke rims are shod in 185/65 Bridgestone Ecopia tyres. Very boring design, if you ask me. Good luck with cleaning it too.
Front & rear body-coloured mud flaps are neatly integrated.
The Ertiga gets a ribbed roof for additional rigidity. Nope, no roof rails, although you will see many Ertigas with roof-mounted carriers. Antenna is mounted at the front.
Tiny HMSL appears to be an after-thought and the washer nozzle could have been better integrated. HMSLs are never a talking point, but this one is terrible.
The rear wiper is now mounted on the glass itself which is a good thing (outgoing car had an L-shaped wiper mounted on the metal portion).
Tail-lamps look similar to the XC40 and CR-V. Only the middle area houses the various bulbs; the top portion and the one on the boot lid isn't functional. Also notice the parallel design lines in the lights.
With all the lights in action. The brake lights are LED (which double up as the pilot lamps as well), while the indicator & reversing lights are regular halogens.
The Ertiga gets only the model badging on the left and the smart hybrid logo on the right. There is no variant or engine badging here. Rear foglamps have been deleted. The outgoing car had one in the middle of the bumper (check it out here).
A close look at the chrome strip that sits above the number plate housing. We appreciate that it’s not too big or overdone.
Reversing camera is to the left of the number plate lights.
4 parking sensors; the outer 2 are mounted higher than the inner 2. Like the front, C-shaped design on the rear bumper as well, surrounding the reflectors.
Spare tyre is located below. No, it is not an alloy wheel, but a regular steel rim in the same size as the others. Tow hook is mounted off center and is visible when standing behind the car.
Side-by-side with the retired model.
I prefer the clean look of the earlier car. The new car's derrière is too busy for my tastes.
It's not difficult to see where the extra length has come from. Wheelbase remains unchanged at 2,740 mm.
The two ruling MPVs in India.

Interior - Front
On the inside, you will find the familiar Maruti interiors, but with a big change = the Ertiga now gets a dashboard that's different from the Swift / Dzire.
The Ertiga's front doors open and shut in a triple-stage action. Ingress and egress are comfortable, thanks to wide opening doors and a small sill area. My grandmother (a senior citizen) found it more car-like and easier to get it than a van, especially when comparing it with an Innova or even a Marazzo. The roof is tall and the seats are placed at a comfortable height. Once inside, there is ample legroom, headroom and shoulder room.
Thanks to the super large windows, the cabin feels airy and welcoming. The second row window is one of the largest that I have seen on a car! The 3rd-row seats also get a bigger window than before, minimising claustrophobia at the absolute rear. The beige seats, door pads, pillars and roof only add to this. The choice of beige carpets and mats will result in them soiling frequently though, especially in a people mover. Black or grey is the best choice of colour for carpets in India.
The dashboard gets a grey shade on the top portion and beige on the bottom. In between, there is a faux wooden trim and a full-length black insert that houses the air-conditioner vents. While the materials used are of average quality (typical Maruti quality), visually the dashboard looks good. Cabin ambience is much improved over the earlier Ertiga.
Overall interior quality is acceptable, but just that for a million+ rupee car. The car is full of hard & scratchy plastics that feel budget-grade. There is also part sharing with others in the Maruti stable, including the window and ORVM controls (even the sunvisor). Frankly, the part quality of the Santro which we tested before this was indisputably the superior. That said, for the money you are putting in, you get a lot of car.
Maruti has added some nice features as well. The 12V socket is now available for all 3 rows, the boot gets a removable tray that can free up room for larger bags (full size check-in bags) and the 3rd-row seats now recline. Fore-aft movement of the front seats has been restricted to liberate more leg space for the middle row. While it's sufficient for my driving style, super tall dudes with a laid-back position will complain. The placement of the screw to release the spare wheel has moved to a difficult spot. In the outgoing car, it was on the boot lip, but it's now moved to the bottom of the boot, requiring one to empty all luggage for a tyre change.
The ergonomics are spot on. You feel right at home even at the first instance of driving this car. While tilt steering has been provided, telescopic adjustment is missing.
Visibility is fantastic. The seating position is higher than in sedans.
A-Pillar is like that of any modern car, but not so thick that it blocks visibility excessively.
Flat bottom steering looks & feels awesome. It gets a leather wrap and thumb contours. The horn pad in the centre is a bit of a stretch. The meeeek horn is inoffensive.
On the left are backlit buttons for the music system (including a useful mute), but the right side is all blank. Some long-distance champions (like Parag Sachania) might miss cruise control.
Pull-type buttons for the phone are placed ergonomically. While they may take some time getting used to, the click-action feels good. The speech recognition button doubles up as a "Siri button" when using Apple CarPlay.
A close look at the stitching on the steering wheel.
Flat bottom area gets fake wooden inserts like the dash. I prefer this design over the Dzire's dark wooden look. Looks damn classy.
Well sized fonts offer good readability. The MID screen welcomes you with a Suzuki logo on start-up. Needles rest at the 6 o'clock position - like in sports cars! I find this blue colour with silver outlines to be neutral. Note that only the petrol gets analog temperature & fuel gauges (diesel has it digital & a different MID too).
It’s about time Maruti retires these old & ugly stalks!! The left one is for the trip meters (A & B), while the right one toggles through various screens of the MID.
The MID displays the clock, date, outside temperature, instantaneous fuel economy and range, average fuel consumption, average FE over time (5 - 15 minutes) or a blank screen if you prefer it uncluttered.
Warnings (like idling start-stop unavailable), infographic on the hybrid system in action, torque and power meters and door open warning. The latter shows you exactly which door is open or if the boot is (nothing for the bonnet, sadly).
The MID's brightness level can be adjusted in 7 levels. MID also displays the idling time & fuel savings by the start-stop system, average speed (with data for the last 5 - 10 minutes) and total driving time.
Press and hold the right stalk to access the MID's menu.
Once the settings are changed, a 'successful' message is displayed. Other settings include door lock options, lane change lights, anti-theft settings and more.
The alarm system's sensors can be tuned in 15 steps, with 1 being the least and 15 the most sensitive. The air-con can be adjusted for standard cooling (default), comfort (better performance) and economy (fuel saving mode - taxi owners rejoice). Among other things, you can also select the car colour of the one shown in the MID.
A peek at some of the other self-explanatory settings.
Stalks are chunky in nature. Notice that the foglamp switch has now moved to the stalk (earlier on the dashboard, to the right of the driver). Should have had auto wipers / lights on the top-end variant.
Engine start button is to the right of the driver.
Rectangular side A/C vents can be adjusted for direction as well as air flow volume. They can be shut, if you so wish.
Switches for the idling start/stop disable and headlight leveller are located below the engine start button.
A small openable storage area on the right (useful for toll money, toll tickets...).
Bonnet release and OBD port are both easy to access.
Fuel lid opener is located at the usual position on the floor.
The front door pad gets a beige and wooden theme. We really like this wooden insert, even if its fake. Expect the bottom of the door pad to get easily soiled.
Same window controls as the other Marutis. They should have revamped this design as well along with the other interior bits.
The door latch is finished in chrome (we like the prominent orange unlock warning). We wish that the elbow rest was covered in soft fabric, instead of this hard plastic.
Door pockets can hold a 1-litre bottle and other knick-knacks.
Door sill is not too wide and doesn't hamper ingress. No scuff plates (as was the case earlier too).
Big & comfortable seats get a dual-tone design with dark inserts. They offer sufficient bolstering & back support.
Large headrest offers sufficient whiplash protection. It is harder than the seats.
Levers to adjust the seat height & recline feel robust.
Fore-aft adjustment is via this lever in front. It is positioned perfectly.
A look at the minimum and maximum seat moment. Fore-aft movement has been restricted to liberate more leg space for the middle row. While it's sufficient for my driving style, super tall dudes with a laid-back position will complain.
Height adjustment has a very good range.
Fabric's design pattern will divide opinions (I liked it, GTO thought its from the 1980s).
Front seatbelts are height-adjustable & come with pre-tensioners + load limiters.
Footwell has adequate width. There is no dead pedal, but you can rest your foot on the left side. That area should have had a rubber strip though.
ORVMs offer a good view of the rear.
IRVM gets manual day-night adjustment! No auto-dimming mirror in a car whose variants can cost 13 lakhs on the road!!
The rearward visibility is hampered by these thick D-pillars and small rear windscreen. With all occupants in place, this view will be further restricted. It’s good that rear parking sensors are standard on the Ertiga, while the top-end gets a camera.
Center fascia is tilted towards the driver. It houses Maruti’s familiar & competent 7" touchscreen ICE.
The screen looks like its stuck on, but it doesn’t protrude out from top like the one in the Nexon. Visibility under sunlight is satisfactory. As always, the ICE is covered in detail in an ensuing post.
Climate control is now offered on the Ertiga. The system is nice & capable. The rear air-con of course helps in keeping this large cabin cool (rear air-con controls are at the back only).
2 cupholders and a rectangular storage area behind (perfect for your smartphone).
Uniquely, these cupholders are cooled. Control the air volume using the knob.
12V socket, along with USB & AUX ports, come with flip-up covers. These covers are flimsy. I have my doubts on whether they will last the lifetime of the car.
The driver gets an adjustable armrest, but it is more of an elbow rest at best. Short folk will find it pointless. This armrest should have been longer.
Opening the armrest reveals a small storage space below.
Handbrake is finished in grey and gets a chrome tip.
A look at the wood trim again. Maruti designers have used this Audi-style full-length grille. You'll see that there are two vents on the side, while the center area is just for aesthetics.
Simple, medium-sized glovebox (no illumination or cooling).
Cabin lamp is located in front of the IRVM. Bluetooth mic is placed here.
Plain & functional sunvisors shared with the Swift / Dzire. Driver gets a ticket holder & passenger gets a vanity mirror. No illumination.
Dual airbags are standard across the range.

Interior - 2nd Row
The rear doors are HUGE and open wide. The high roof, comfortable floor height and well-placed seats make ingress & egress very easy (tested by my Grandma).
There is a sufficient gap between the B-pillar and the seat making it easy to step in or out. This is only when the seat is adjusted backward though; move it forward and the gap diminishes.
Door sill isn't that wide either - occupants don't need to swing their legs much to move in and out of the car.
Like the front, the rear doorpads are beige. However, that nice-looking wooden insert is missing. Not cool, Maruti! Despite its sheer size, the door doesn't require much effort to open or close due to the light sheet metal.
There is a 1.5L bottle holder and a long cubby behind it to store other items. The latter is very slim though. Won't be easy to pick objects up from the base.
The Ertiga comes with a 7-seater configuration, although a 6-seater variant with captain seats is on the way. The middle row is comfortable for 3 occupants. It's wider than the outgoing car, yes. The driver's seat here is adjusted for a reasonably tall driver (remember my earlier comment on how their fore & aft range is restricted?). There is just enough legroom even with the front seat in the rearmost position (passenger seat in this image).
The seatback has some contours (to accommodate the armrest), but not so much as to cause discomfort to the middle occupant. Only the outer occupants get adjustable headrests.
The cushioning is adequate. It's also minimally raised in the middle.
While all others get a 3-point seatbelt, the middle occupant has to make do with a lap belt. It can be neatly tucked away when not in use.
Middle row seats can slide forward and backward using this lever. Unless the 3rd row is occupied, the seat will be pushed all the way back.
Here is a look at the different extremes. The seats can be moved over 6 inches and it sure offers flexibility in the seating / cargo config.
What's more, the seats can also be reclined for comfort. The minimum and maximum seat recline possible are shown here.
Even with the front seats in the last position, a 6-footer like me can sit. Two 6-footers can easily fit, one behind the other. The adjustable headrests are positioned perfectly and there is ample head room.
Front seatback is scooped to liberate more legroom behind.
With the front seat adjusted to my height, there is a good 3-4 inches of leg space remaining. With the middle row moved all the way forward and the front seats in the last position, my legs touch the seat back - they are soft, so no hurting the knees / shin area. The last picture depicts 2 inches of space with the front seats pushed all the way back and the middle row adjusted to accommodate me in the 3rd row. The space packaging is simply brilliant.
Soft carpet lining - good for the shin area of your legs. Foot room is sufficient.
The floor hump isn't a bother and it tapers down toward the rear. Still, the middle row occupant will prefer to keep his legs on either side as the console eats into the available foot space.
ISOFIX child seat mounts are provided as standard on all variants.
Anchor points are visually hidden behind the seat cushion. 2 ISOFIX child seats can be installed on the middle row.
Armrest opens up at a comfortable height. It is soft and both passengers can use it. There are no cup-holders though. Maruti should realise that the 10+ lakh variants should NOT get the same cost cutting as their <10-lakh cars.
Rear aircon is roof-mounted & gets 4 adjustable vents. Has independent fan speed control, but the knob & vents look so outdated. More 2009 than 2019! Even the plastic quality is mediocre. Cooling was effective for such a big cabin with a huge glass area. Do note that the front a/c needs to be switched on for the rear air-con.
A look at the roof moulding - beige makes it an airy cabin.
Rear cabin lamp is placed on top of the 2nd row seats, which is better than the earlier 3rd-row positioning. This way, it serves the purpose of both seat rows.
Massive window lets in ample light into the cabin. Passengers will enjoy a good view of the world outside.
Rear window can be rolled almost all the way in.
Both front seats get seatback pockets for dumping odd items.
Middle row gets an independent 12V socket. Notice the sticker that says max power rating of 120W..this is for all the 3 power outlets combined.
The space below the 12V socket can be used to park a smartphone. While it could house my 4-inch iPhone, users with today's phones (5 - 6 inches) might find the space insufficient. Overall, its an awkwardly designed storage area. Note that the area below is open.
Spring-loaded grab handles get a soft-closing action. No coat / bag hooks have been provided.
There is a slot to park the seatbelt when you fold the middle row down. I prefer to slot it in even when the rear seat is empty (I found the unsecured belt buckle hitting the C-pillar on bad roads etc.).

Interior - 3rd Row
Pull this handle to tilt and recline the middle row seats in one go. While the idea is nice, I have doubts over the longevity of this piece of plastic. Reason = people will apply force on the plastic rather than the seatback to move it.
The seat doesn't tumble away - it just folds. This is the space through which one has to climb into the 3rd row. Of course, dont expect the elderly or even most adults to use the last row. While I could get inside, it is best saved for the kids or shorter adults.
The seatback does fold down, but it doesn't help in the ingress in any way. Can be used to haul cargo though, along with the folded rear seats.
Getting inside is a one leg after the other affair. I actually found it easier to get inside in reverse so that you can straight away sit on the seat (instead of climbing in, then turning around and sitting).
Where the Ertiga has really improved space-wise is the last row. It is usable and adults can actually sit here! This wasn't the case with the outgoing Ertiga. The legroom in the last row has increased by 70 mm, while shoulder room is up by 34 mm.
Even 6-foot me could manage to sit here. Of course, you need to have friendly relations with the folks in the middle row as they control the 3rd row's legroom. Thigh support - as is the case with most 3rd rows - is mediocre.
Adjustable headrests have been provided (all the way up or all the way down).
Last row seats get recline-adjustment. A look at the maximum & minimum recline angles.
Headroom should be okay for most. However, if you recline the seat backward, your head will touch the roof. With the seat up, a 6-footer will have an inch of clearance.
The occupant sitting on the left will have to watch out for the front seat rails. They are right in front of you, due to the middle row's 40:60 split ratio. Hence, your feet need to be positioned around it.
Window size has increased! It lets in a good amount of light and makes the rear airy / less claustrophobic.
Fixed grab handles for 3rd-row passengers.
There is now a 12V charging socket at the back. It serves 2 purposes - with the seats in place, passengers can charge their smartphones and with the seats folded, you have a 12V powered fridge (or another accessory) in the boot. Maruti has a fridge among their official accessories.
Usable armrests on either side of the seat for 3rd-row occupants. Hard plastic though.
Cupholders are provided on both sides (1L bottles are an easy fit). The exposed screw looks cheap IMHO.
Boot space stands at 209 litres (outgoing car = 135 litres) with all the rows in place. Medium-sized bag placed for scale.
Uniquely, the boot gets a removable base. You can either remove it to accommodate taller bags (demonstrated in an ensuing image) or you can park stuff underneath this base. Example, a laptop that you want to keep out of prying eyes when the car is parked.
550 litres of space with the 3rd row down.
BHPian ParagSachania says that you can now slide the 2nd row all the way behind, and still fold the 3rd row fully down (wasn't possible in the outgoing Ertiga). Do note that the seats can individual fold too (50:50 split), in case there are 6 onboard and lots of luggage.
With the second and 3rd row folded down, the boot space increases to 803 litres. 60:40 split middle row offers added flexibility for passenger / cargo configurations.
Notice how the taller bag is kept with the storage tray removed to accommodate it vertically. This removable base will
really come in handy only when there are occupants on the 3rd-row (3rd-row occupants will have to recline their seat up if you want to carry tall + big bags).
A boot lamp is conspicuous by its absence in this million-rupee car. Behind this cover are all the tools which are neatly arranged to prevent any rattles. Look at the bottom of this picture and you'll see that the cover itself gets insulating material.
The screw to release the spare wheel now moves to the base of the boot, making it a major task to swap tyres if your boot is full. The outgoing car had it more conveniently on the boot lip (reference image).
The underside of the tail-gate gets full beige cladding and a handle to close it.

In-Car Entertainment
The Ertiga comes with Maruti's familiar 7-inch touchscreen entertainment system. Apart from the usual connectivity options, it comes with Android Auto & Apple CarPlay too. Sound quality is strictly average (typical Maruti stuff). If you like your music, you might want to upgrade the speakers. Daytime visibility of the screen is good. Maruti has continuously improved this head-unit over the years and today, it's a pleasure to use.
Sound comes from 2 tweeters mounted on each of the front doors and a speaker lower down on each of the doors. The volume is good for the first two rows, but needs to be cranked up for the guys sitting in the last row.
Press the center icon to launch a shortcut - depending on the media being played, options include next / previous radio channel, contact list and call menu, quit running Android Auto / CarPlay, access the Favourites / Previous menu in Navigation, next / previous song (short tap) and seek (long tap) when playing songs. Very cool.
Album art also shown via Bluetooth.
A look at the preset EQs. Doesn't matter as audio quality is just average.
Speed dependent volume control gets 3 levels. I preferred Level 2.
Brightness levels can be set for Day / Night / Auto and the brightness adjusted from 0-7 levels.
India's largest car manufacturer - and one listed on our stock exchange - doesn't offer Hindi? Maruti should learn from Hyundai (check out the Santro here).
Nice & unique option = the keypad can be locked while the car is on the move for safety reasons.
Speech recognition is also built in. It can be triggered using the dedicated button on the steering wheel or via the button beside the screen.
The Apple CarPlay screen. Smartphone integration is truly a boon.
Google Maps is the best out there & now available on Apple CarPlay too! The car's inbuilt navigation will most likely never see the light of day.
Destinations can also be selected based on recent searches, home / work address, saved places and petrol pumps.
Now, if only this interface listed which are the company-owned & company-operated pumps (a favourite with BHPians).
Select one and the list can be visually seen on the map, along with the distance and time.
With the navigation running, the main screen displays the route, while the right side has the next step + ETA + distance remaining.
Tapping the messages will go into voice prompt by default. You can access unread messages or reply to them via Siri.
Only the sender name is displayed and tapping that opens up the voice prompt. There is no way to open a keyboard to type a message; we appreciate this feature.
Stuck in long traffic jams? Just install a few audiobooks to learn or be entertained.
Apart from Apple CarPlay, Android Auto is provided as well.
Connecting for the first time gives an Ok Google prompt. IMHO, voice commands significantly improve overall safety as it allows the driver to keep his eyes on the road.
Apps like Play Music & Gaana can be used for music. The 'default' music app on your phone is shown on the music tab.
Reversing camera offers good clarity, even under the bright sun (as seen here). The guidelines are fixed. The camera + parking sensor combo is a must-have in this car.
Night time clarity is average, yet sufficient. You can see the pixels blown up.
There is no remote control provided, but chauffeur-driven folk can download the Maruti-Suzuki remote app on their smartphones & use it to control the system.
You get full control of the ICE.
Help" can be used for understanding the initial setup. Its easy & no one will face any setup issues.
The next screen reveals all the media options that can be played. Notice the attention to detail - the small picture of the screen has the same view as the  actual display.
Songs played over Bluetooth can be controlled as well, but no song information is displayed. This is an opportunity for improvement as Ive seen many chauffeur-driven owners in Ertigas.

Driving the 1.5L Petrol MT
After the Ciaz, this 1.5L K15 engine now comes to the Ertiga. Notice that it doesn't get an engine cover! Service intervals remain unchanged at 10,000 km / 1 year.
The old Ertiga's 1.4L petrol was rather mediocre. Well, things have improved with the new 1.5L (although not by that much). The 2019 Ertiga is powered by a 1,462cc, 4-cylinder K15 engine that puts out 103 BHP @ 6,000 rpm and 138 Nm @ 4,400 rpm. The power and torque figures are higher than the old 1.4L's 94 BHP and 130 Nm.
It must also be remembered that the Ertiga's weight has gone down by 25 kg to 1,135 kilos. So, while the old car's power-to-weight and torque-to-weight ratios stood at 81 BHP / ton and 112 Nm / ton, the new car's figures are 91 BHP / ton and 122 Nm / ton. That's exactly 10 more on each ratio.
The new engine sure feels like an upsized version of the old motor. A lot of characteristics are similar (including some areas of the 'driving feel'). Overall, the 1.5L is better than the 1.4L, yet the difference isn't night & day.
The ZXi & ZXi+ variants are equipped with keyless entry & go. To start the car, press the clutch and hit the start button. The engine fires up with very little noise and without transmitting any vibrations to the cabin. At idle, it is silent. Press the clutch and you'll find that its light enough. The gear shifter is light & smooth to use. Its gates are well-defined too.
Release the clutch gradually and the car moves forward without any throttle input. You can even pull away from a standstill in 2nd, albeit with some extra accelerator input! Throttle response is satisfactory. Power comes in smooth & seamless. Low speed driveability is excellent and in the lower gears, the car can pull reasonably well at anything over 1,000 rpm, though it is comfortable post 1,300 rpm. The way the engine is tuned makes the Ertiga a very practical car to drive in urban surroundings. Further, when you have 7 occupants onboard, a good bottom end is most important, not only for driveability, but also on inclines. This is where the motor really scores. What's more, the 1.5L is refined at low revs.
On the open road, the Ertiga feels adequately quick, but far from being really fast. Like the old Ertiga 1.4L, the Ertiga 1.5L is more of a 'cruiser' rather than a 'racer' (just as well - don't forget you're driving an MPV!). Power delivery is linear and there is enough performance available to get the job done. When pushed, the engine revs to 6,300 rpm. And with a full load of passengers & cargo, you will need to work it hard at times. Again, the Ertiga is more suited to a sedate driving style. This Maruti can comfortably cruise at 100 km/h & 120 km/h with the tachometer reading 2,800 rpm & 3,400 rpm respectively.
We feel that the rev limit of 6,300 rpm is very conservative. Sometimes, in the middle of overtaking maneuvers, you have to shift up. For the sake of comparison, we'll mention that many other 1.5L petrols touch 7,000 rpm. The best way to sum up this engine is that it's 'adequate', which is the exact same term we'd used for the old 1.4L! This really goes to prove that Suzuki's competence is in small engines, not big ones (even the SX4's 1.6L & Vitara's 2.0L weren't that impressive).
Coming to NVH levels, the engine is silent while idling and acceptably refined at low revs. However, it is audible above 2,000 rpm. You can
always hear the motor when you are accelerating. It starts getting loud post 3,500 rpm, and a lot more so after 4,500 rpm. On the highway, wind noise is present and even tyre noise starts earlier than you would expect. In the city as well, exterior sounds are easily heard inside the cabin. We actually thought once or twice that a window has been left open (it wasn't). The cabin's sound insulation is overall poor.
Smart Hybrid System.
Maruti's Smart Hybrid tech has found its way into the Ertiga petrol. Unlike the diesel, the Smart Hybrid system in the petrol Ertiga uses a dual-battery setup. While there is a conventional lead acid battery in the engine bay, a lithium-ion battery sits under the front passenger's seat.
This Smart Hybrid system is at best a very mild hybrid, and not a proper one like say, the ones seen in higher-end Toyotas. It essentially employs an integrated starter generator (ISG), whose primary objective is to enhance fuel-efficiency & reduce emissions. The ISG is a device which has dual function - motoring as well as generation. It's belt driven and connected to a pulley, which is in turn, connected to the crankshaft. It allows greater electrical generation capacity.
The system switches the engine off when the car comes to a standstill and neutral is engaged. Upon pressing the clutch, the engine fires up again. We must say, Maruti has sure been working on the idling start-stop function. Frankly, it’s not bad at all in the petrol; even GTO -
who absolutely hates start / stop systems - said he wouldn't mind leaving it on in the Ertiga. The shutdown was almost seamless, while the startup wasn't a bother at all. Yep, there is a button to disable this feature if you so wish. The conventional lead acid battery in the engine bay is used by the idling start / stop system.
The system also includes brake energy regeneration. In this, when the brakes are applied, the kinetic energy generated is converted into electric energy. This electric energy is stored in both the batteries. The Li-ion battery assists the engine by providing a little extra torque when the car needs to accelerate quickly. Do note that the batteries get charged even while the vehicle is coasting. While cruising, the electricity stored in the batteries is supplied to the various electrical components.
The ARAI FE rating has gone up to 19.34 km/l against the old car's 16.04 km/l. That is a significant improvement! It's even more impressive when you consider that the engine size, power & torque have all increased.
An engine for the mass market / sedate drivers, but not enthusiasts. Maruti has priced all the petrol variants of the Ertiga under 10 lakhs (even the automatic!). While this has tax benefits, the sticker price being under 10L rupees is a marketing tool as well.
Petrol gets an insulation sheet under the bonnet, just like the diesel.
No underbody protection at all!! Not even a plastic cover below the engine.
Vacant space beside the radiator houses the vertical intercooler in the diesel.
Exide Conservo battery is used - replacing it with some other make will disable the hybrid system. The "ISS" stands for integrated start / stop.
The same is mentioned on the warning sticker.
Sticker underneath the bonnet tells you about the placement of the lead acid and lithium-ion batteries. It claims that the Li-ion battery can also be used for vehicle start.
5-speed gear lever gets a glossy black top with a chrome ring around it. The gates are well-defined and the shift action is smooth.
Gearshift suggesting tool shows when & which gear to shift to (bottom left of the MID). It will display a dot when you are in the correct gear. Newbies will appreciate this feature.
Li-ion battery is placed under the front passenger's seat.
It gets a ventilation channel at the front.
Battery warnings and recycling instructions.
Petrol doesn't get any labelling here. Don't be careless - ensure that the petrol pump attendant fills the right fuel in your Ertiga.

Driving the 1.3L Diesel MT
Makes 89 BHP @ 4,000 rpm and 200 Nm @ 1,750 rpm.
Under the Ertiga diesel's hood is the familiar Fiat-sourced 1.3L engine with a variable geometry turbo (VGT). We've seen this engine in so many cars that we call it the 'national engine of India'. This old engine is better in a hatchback or compact sedan, but in a 10+ lakh rupee Ertiga?  One of the weakest links in the package. The engine is too small, lethargic at the low-end and too old at this price point (the Marazzo's diesel engine feels so much better!).
All we can say is we're glad Maruti is soon going to introduce a new 1.5L diesel with a 6-speed MT.
The diesel car weighs 1220 kg, a decrease of 15 kg over the outgoing model. Hence, the power-to-weight ratio has improved to 73 BHP / ton, while the torque-to-weight ratio is 164 Nm / ton. Press the clutch, hit the engine start / stop button to fire her up and there's no getting away from the fact that she's an oil-burner. Vibrations at start-up are well managed, albeit you'll always know its a diesel thanks to the familiar clatter. Revv it and the diesel gets audible inside the cabin.
If you've driven a Vitara Brezza, Ciaz or the S-Cross 1.3, you've pretty much experienced the Ertiga. Their behaviour has a lot in common. At low rpms and within the city, the 89 BHP diesel does have some amount of turbo-lag. It isn't excessive though, nor is the engine dead below 2,000 rpm. Things are acceptable in the 1,500 - 1,800 revv range and you can still push on in the same gear. It won't bother you (unless you are carrying a full load of passengers). However, when the revv needle drops too low or you need instant punch, you'll have to downshift. No two sides to that. In people movers, more than any other vehicle category, there is no replacement for displacement. You need a strong bottom end; the 1.3L just doesn't cut it when you might have 7 in the car. Low end torque is incomparable to what the Marazzo offers. You'll also be downshifting more when climbing up mountain roads where the lag can catch you out, as we discovered on the Lonavala Ghat section.
Open-road acceleration is adequate, but not exciting. Once the turbo is spooling, there is a noticeable spike and you'll find the mid-range to be punchy. Highway performance is decent - overtaking capability is fair as long as the revv needle is hovering over 2,000 rpm (else you need to downshift). The seating position helps, giving the driver excellent visibility. This 1.3L diesel is free-revving in nature and willing to go beyond 5,000 rpm when you need to hold a gear. In terms of cruisability, 100 km/h in 5th gear sees the tacho kiss 2,400 rpm, while 120 km/h comes up at ~2,900 rpm. Not as relaxed as the Marazzo diesel which does the same speeds at 2,000 rpm & 2,400 rpm (respectively). While the Ertiga is no speeding rocket - especially when all seat rows are full - it can be a decent inter-city traveller. Just that we expect more in a car whose top ZDi+ variant costs 13+ lakhs OTR in Mumbai.
The NVH package is strictly average, and you aren't aloof from the world outside or even the engine. The diesel's clatter can be heard on the move too, even if the air-con and music system are running. Within the city at low rpms, things are alright. As the rpm needle climbs, it's far from being whisper quiet (post 4,000 rpm, it gets loud). As mentioned in the petrol engine post, the cabin's sound insulation is poor. Road, tyre & wind noise are higher than average on the expressway. You can also hear bikers talking around the car when waiting at a signal! On the other hand, vibration levels are well under control.
The 5-speed gearbox is the same as the Ciaz / Vitara Brezza and behaves the same too. The gates are properly defined and the lever is sure slotting. It's a good gearbox to use, even if it's not the slickest of units around. The clutch is light enough (for a diesel). The pedal has just the right amount of weight and is never cumbersome to use (stating this after spending several hours in crawling Mumbai traffic).
The diesel too comes with Marutis SHVS tech, minus the second Li-ion battery under the front passengers seat. The diesel's start / stop system is nowhere as smooth as the petrol's though. This engine is known for its efficiency and it's no different under the hood of the Ertiga. The ARAI rating is 24.47 km/l (outgoing car = 24.52 km/l). The terrific fuel-economy should keep owners happy.
The national engine of India gets Suzuki DDiS branding.
No underbody protection on the diesel either. Maruti could have offered the underbody plate as an accessory for highway tourers who are willing to pay extra for it.
The diesel too gets an Exide Conservo battery. It is bigger than the one on the petrol.
Proper cold air intake. It sucks in fresh air right from the front of the car.
Unlike the petrol, the diesels tacho gets a 5,000 rpm redline and a far more basic black & white MID. It has readings for dual trip meters, average and instantaneous fuel consumption, gear position indicator, outside temperature, clock and a digital fuel gauge. Sadly, the temperature gauge is missing (related thread (Good 'ol Temperature Gauge : Yes or No?)), which the petrol very much has.
Gearshift indicator shows which gear to shift to. Newbies will appreciate this feature.
Unlike the petrol, the diesel's fuel flap gets a small sticker indicating its diet.

Ride & Handling
The Ertiga is equipped with a ubiquitous MacPherson strut  suspension at the front and a torsion beam setup at the rear. The suspension does feel more mature than in the outgoing car. Ride quality is compliant & the MPV soaks in bumps acceptably well. Do note that it's not plush either (don't expect any Lodgy-like magic here). A key advantage over its ladder-on-frame competitors is that there is no side-by-side movement when tackling bad roads. Expressway ride comfort is decent as well. On undulating highways however, the rear has a tendency to bounce & feel wallowy. Solution? Back off the accelerator on such roads. Overall, we'll say that it's a typical Maruti suspension. No owner will complain, but no owner will be bragging about it either.
Owners will appreciate how the Ertiga is so car-like to drive. There is no learning curve for those upgrading from a hatchback or sedan. The grip levels are good and cornering ability is at par or slightly  better-than-expected for an MPV. The handling is neutral in nature. We  pushed the Ertiga hard on some curves and she kept her line. That said, the resultant body roll is enough to remind drivers that its a  tall vehicle. Body roll is there, yet well controlled by MPV standards. Straight line stability is fair at 120 km/h. It behaves as a family car should and there aren't any nasty surprises.
The EPS is light enough in the city, while the turning radius of 5.2 meters is identical to the outgoing car. At speed, the steering weighs up adequately. Enthusiasts shouldn't expect any feedback though.
The 180 mm of ground clearance is sufficient and we never bottomed out - even on some very poor roads. Final verdict, as always, remains with Team-BHP's ownership reports.
Braking is par for the course in the city. There is very little pedal travel before the brakes bite. Brake hard and the car feels stable, maintaining its composure. When you are carrying a full load of passengers at highway speeds though, you will wish that the braking hardware was more powerful. ABS + EBD are standard on all variants, while ESP and hill-hold are offered only on the petrol AT.

Other Points
While the automatic is only available in the VXi and ZXi trims, we  expect the company to release the ZXi+ AT at a later date.
CNG variants were absent at launch. CNG is a popular fuel choice for urban commuters in cities like Mumbai and Delhi. Maruti won't miss out on this and we expect a CNG version in the future.
Base LXi / LDi variants don't get the rear air conditioner. The taxi segment & their customers will be upset.
Don't like all that bling at the front? Check out the grille design of the base variant Should be easy & quick to source.
Only the Z+ variants get the nice touchscreen ICE; lower variants come with this head-unit.It's a pretty sad HU; owner A4Anurag doesn't like it either.
Press the unlock button once (remote or request sensor) to unlock just the driver's door. Press it twice to unlock all the doors.
Yes, the Ertiga does get doors that auto-lock as you drive away.
Maruti recommends using the Exide Conservo DIN70 battery for the Ertiga diesel and the ISS N55 for the petrol.
The price of the Li-ion battery. It costs a whopping Rs. 53,685 to replace. Further, one must never let this battery discharge completely as it will not recharge again. Maruti recommends a minimum of 30 minutes of engine running time per week to prevent this from happening.
Compared to the outgoing car, the base LXi variant's price has gone up by Rs. 1,11,000! However, the other variants get a price hike of 21 - 72k. The VDi variant is actually cheaper by Rs. 2,000. Two of the reasons behind the petrol's price hike = new engine + SHVS.
Maruti has definitely cashed in on the success of the Ertiga & how. It's still well-priced though & you get a lot of car for the money.
A 6-seater version with captain seats is rumoured to go on sale soon.
Fuel tank capacity is 45 litres. The ARAI ratings are 19.34 km/l for the Petrol Manual, 18.69 km/l for the Petrol Automatic and 25.47 km/l for the Diesel.
The Ertiga comes with a 2-year / 40,000 km warranty as standard. Maruti offers a 5-year / 1,00,000 km extended warranty. Highly recommended (Related Link). The dual-battery setup of the petrol isn't proven yet.
First service (checkup) at 1,000 km / 1 month & second visit at 5,000 km / 6 months. Next one is at 10k km / 1 year with the same interval for all following ones. First 3 services are labour-free.
Apart from the Pearl Metallic Auburn Red colour of our test car, the  Ertiga is available in 4 more shades - Metallic Magma Grey, Pearl  Metallic Oxford Blue, Pearl Arctic White and Metallic Silky Silver. How boring - should have had a wider range of colours. Available in 4 trims - L, V, Z and Z+.
The K15B petrol needs engine oil of a very weird grade = 0W-16. Thanks to BHPian Leoshashi for pointing it out in this post.
Ever wondered if 3 adults could fit on the last row, but didnt know who to ask? BHPian JS Kwt has the answer in this post

The Smaller yet Significant Things
While the CNG variant is not available right now, the fuel filler has space for the CNG nozzle.
Full wheel well cladding is provided at the front as well as the rear.
Diesel variants of the Ertiga get a DDiS badge on both front fenders.
45L fuel tank is housed under the 2nd-row seats. The Marazzo gets a 45L tank too, while the Innova Crysta gets a 55L one.
With just the foglamps on. They illuminate the area ahead quite well.
Standard projector low beams are adjusted nicely. Their sharp cut-off can be noticed as well.
In comparison, the high beams are mediocre.
Recommended tyre pressures are 29 PSI all around for 1-4 occupants + luggage, and a high 32 PSI front with a 38 PSI rear for 5-7 occupants + luggage. Also note the rim size - 15 X 5.5J, in case you want to get after-market wheels (the OEM rim design is sooooooo boring).
What on earth was Maruti thinking! Beige flooring and beige carpeting is a disaster just waiting to happen. Soils easily. In India, a darker shade (if not black) is convenient and easier to maintain. Look at the dirt already gathered on our test car after just one drive.
Nifty hooks hold the driver-side mat in place so that it doesn't foul with the pedals while driving.
All switches on the steering and dashboard get orange backlighting. Power window buttons? Only the driver's is illuminated.
This light comes on when the diesel engine is still cold & hasn't reached its operating temperature (petrol gets a temp gauge). Keep the revs low until this light disappears.
A-Off" light comes up when the idling start / stop system has been disabled. We don't see owners disabling it in the petrol where the action is very smooth (you might in the diesel though).
This green light comes on when the engine has been shut off by the idling start / stop system. It will blink thrice before turning off the engine.
Turn off the car with the lights on and you get this warning indicator + an audible sound as reminders.
Drive summary displayed on the MID when you turn off the car. It even shows the total fuel saved by the idling start / stop system!
Request sensor to lock / unlock the boot is also provided on the tailgate. Very nifty.
The blue smartkey. Thanks to the keyless entry system, you don't even need to take out the key from your pocket / bag.
