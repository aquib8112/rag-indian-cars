BMW 5-Series Cons
Looks will polarize opinions. Not your usual BMW timeless design. Also has some quirky bits
Handling is not like the outgoing 5-Series. Softer, comfort-oriented suspension and long wheelbase mean it's not a driver-oriented enthusiast's machine. Doesn’t get adaptive suspension either (outgoing 5-Series had it)
No 6-cylinder petrol engine or diesel available. The only option you have is a 4-cylinder petrol
Misses some mandatory features like rear sunblinds, and expected features like the head-up display
Thanks to the long wheelbase, you have to be careful over large speed breakers. Especially if you are travelling with people and luggage
Due to the way the rear seat is contoured - and that massive transmission tunnel - it is best for 4 adults to travel comfortably, not 5

Introduction
The BMW 5 Series has always been considered a good all-rounder. It’s the right size for a proper luxury car and has something for the driver as well. This segment, however, saw a paradigm shift when Mercedes launched the long-wheelbase E-Class back in 2016, which focused on the rear seat. BMW also has a long-wheelbase version of the 5 Series (G68) that’s on sale in China. To take on Mercedes, they decided to bring that to India. Will this version of the 5 Series receive the same love as the E-Class? Only time will tell. But at least the added space in the rear gives the 5 Series a fighting chance.
So, what’s new in this generation of the 5 Series? It’s still based on BMW’s Cluster Architecture (CLAR) platform that underpinned the previous generation (G30) 5 series. However, this is an updated platform (CLAR-WE). To simplify the nomenclature, the G60 is the normal wheelbase 5 Series sedan, the G61 is the estate version and the G68 is the long-wheelbase sedan we get in India. The exterior and interior styling have been completely revised in this generation and the 5 Series is now a size bigger than the previous generation model. The most important change, as mentioned earlier, is in the wheelbase, which has gone up by 130 mm to 3,105 mm. In the engine department, the previous generation offered one petrol and two diesel engines, but the G68 5 Series is available only in the 530Li guise. It’s powered by a 2.0-litre, 4-cylinder petrol engine with a 48V mild hybrid tech integrated into the transmission.
Looking back at the previous generations of the 5 Series, you'll notice that BMW alternates between building an ultimate driving machine and then going in the completely opposite direction of being comfort-oriented. As an example, the E60 generation was the ultimate sports sedan. Replacing it came the F10 series which had a very comfort-oriented suspension. It was fast, but it was big and soft around the corners. Next up was the G30 which had a superb ride and handling balance and was a lot of fun to drive. It also had adaptive dampers for India which was a big plus. Replacing that is the G68 5 Series which doesn't get the adaptive dampers, and is extremely comfort-oriented.
It has been a long wait since the launch of the G68, but we finally got to drive the car. So let’s get into the details.
BMW 5 Series Price & Brochure
BMW has launched the 5 Series at Rs. 72.90 lakh (ex-showroom), which is a fair price. Considering that the Mercedes E-Class starts at Rs. 78.50 lakh, we feel the pricing is reasonable. One disadvantage that the 5 Series has is that it doesn’t offer a diesel engine, which the Mercedes does. The other cars in this segment are the Audi A6 (Rs. 64.41 lakh - Rs. 70.79 lakh), Lexus ES (Rs. 64 lakh - Rs. 69.70 lakh) and the Volvo S90 (Rs. 68.25 lakh).

BMW 5 Series Exterior Review
Front end is radically different. A lot has changed from the previous generation and this design has been receiving some hate. But when you spend some time with the car, it grows on you. It is outlandish and does grab eyeballs on the road.
The rear is more subtle compared to the front and very much resembles the bigger 7 Series.
The side profile is where the biggest difference is. The wheelbase has gone up by 130 mm and measures 3,105 mm. You can clearly see the 2.5-box design in this picture where the roof slopes directly into the boot.
This is the Sparkling Copper Grey paint shade which almost looks light blue to an extent. Up close, you can see the metallic copper in the paint. The Titanium Bronze accents that you see on the grille and window line are available with the Sparkling Copper Grey and Carbon Black paint shades. You can also opt for the more subtle Satin Aluminium trim with the Mineral White, Phytonic Blue and Carbon Black paint shades.
The 5 Series Long Wheelbase measures 5,175 mm in length (+ 212 mm), 1,900 mm in width (+32 mm) and 1,520 mm in height (+41 mm).
Big kidney grille is illuminated and stands out in the night. You get a wide air dam at the bottom which has a piano black surround. Just look at the number of creases all over the front.
LED headlights have a two-lamp layered setup with vertical LED DRLs on the side. Note the blue accents on the inside.
Bonnet gets multiple prominent creases. Bonnet shut line extends into the grille that protrudes slightly. This design aspect is a throwback to the Sharknose design of the older generations.
Body-coloured ORVMs have integrated turn indicators and also house the side cameras for the 360-degree view feature. Notice the M badge on the fender.
18-inch alloy wheels have a Y-spoke design and a lot of the comments mention that they look small. But, theyre the same size as the Mercedes E-Class (
reference image
with the same tyre size as well. Its the perception that makes them look smaller. The spokes dont extend all the way to the rims edge which is why they look smaller.
Customers can also go for the optional 19" M alloy wheels which have a design that looks much fuller and more proportionate.
225/55 R18 Vredestein Ultrac Vorti tyres provide good grip.
Sleek door handle gets a request sensor on the front passenger side.
Not a big fan of the embossed 5 on the Hofmeister kink. GTO hates it.
The 5 Series gets a big panoramic glass roof.
Camera for the driving assist features is placed on top.
Big horizontal tail-lights look similar to the 7 Series. These look classy. You get a "530 Li" badge on the right side of the boot.
Dual exhaust tips are hidden away under the car. The accents on the bumper feel a bit overdone though.

BMW 5 Series Interior Review
Step inside the 5 Series and you’ll immediately notice the familiar BMW bits. The ergonomics are spot on and you will feel at home. In terms of design, however, a lot has changed. You get a modern and minimalistic look with very few buttons. The quality of materials is good and the fit and finish are excellent.
Flat bottom three-spoke steering wheel is chunky and a joy to hold. It even gets a top dead-centre marker, but it’s not coloured. The spokes have golden coloured accents and the bottom spoke also gets an "M" badge.
Paddle shifters are big and easy to use. They’re responsive and you can use them when you want to have some fun. The 5 Series also gets a Sport Boost function which puts your car in the most optimum settings for maximum performance.
You get a 12.3-inch MID behind. The display is crisp and there are multiple layouts that you can choose from.
One very useful feature is that you can mirror your Google Maps (from Android Auto or Apple CarPlay) onto the MID. This is very useful as the passenger can then use the touchscreen for other stuff. The MID also has G force measurement. The last image is the display you get when you activate the Sport Boost function.
Doorpad gets an all-black theme with a leather insert on the armrest.
Light strip from the dashboard continues onto the door trim. The buttons for locking / unlocking and the memory seat controls are touch-sensitive. Notice the Bowers & Wilkins tweeter on top.
Front seats are finished in vegan leather and feel nice. They’re ventilated too. The seats though, provide good overall comfort and support. Tall passengers will feel that the under-thigh support could’ve been better. In comparison, the E-Class seats feel more plush and comfortable and they also get adjustable under-thigh support. The front passenger seat feels low even in the tallest height setting which means you have to either stretch your legs out in the front into the footwell or sit in a knees-up seating position.
Rearward visibility is limited thanks to the small windshield and the tall rear headrests.
ORVMs are big and provide a good view of the action behind. They also get blind spot warnings.
14.9-inch BMW curved display sits in the middle. It gets the latest generation BMW operating system 8.5. It is mated to Bowers & Wilkins Surround Sound System with 18 speakers and 655 watts. The slot below the touchscreen has hidden A/C vents.
Touchscreen has a very nice and crisp display. The menus though, I found aren’t very straightforward and you will take some time to get used to them. A/C controls are through the touchscreen. It gets wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. There is no simple button to select drive modes. The "My Modes" button opens up a menu and then you have to select your preferred mode. There are 2 primary settings – Comfort and Sport (more on this later). The displays for the useful reversing camera and 360-degree view system are nice.
The panel below has touch-sensitive controls for fan speed and other HVAC controls. I didn’t find these controls to be very intuitive. The direction of airflow is controlled with the two small knobs below.
Dedicated space for the front passengers to park their phones. Driver side gets wireless charging. You get two cupholders as well.
Most of the controls are placed here. The crystal knob can be used to navigate through various options on the touchscreen. Traditional gear selector has also been replaced with a small crystalline selector. You have media controls for the next and previous song selection along with a crystal volume control roller.
Centre armrest is set at a nice height and is wide enough for both front passengers to use. It also gets a contrast blue stitching and the storage space underneath is illuminated and gets a 12V power outlet.
With the new generation, BMW has also introduced an NFC digital key card. You can also have a digital key on your phone.
You get this wooden finish dashboard trim with lightning-like detailing. I think it looks fine, but GTO doesn’t like it at all. Feels out of place in a classy cabin. If you want a simple wood finish, you have to choose the Aluminium Satin package for the exterior. There’s also a crystalline light bar on top which looks very nice.
Piano black roof console has buttons for the interior lights and the sunshade control.
Below the SOS button, you get an interior selfie camera!
Massive panoramic glass roof lets in plenty of light.
Getting in and out of the rear seats is as you would expect in a low sedan, but it’s not cumbersome. The seats get nice contours and offer good all-round support. Under-thigh support is also enough for tall passengers (E-Class gets adjustable under-thigh support). The seats are cushy and should be comfortable over long drives. One good thing is that the seats extend all the way to the door. This might be a controversial opinion, but I don’t think the vegan leather looks very premium.
Backrest is also set at a nice angle. However, you do miss on the electric adjustment that the E-Class offers. Also, note that the 5 Series doesn’t have window sunshades or a rear sunshade. You can get them as accessories, but that’s a magnetic one which is nowhere as good as the one integrated into the doorpad. The E-Class gets an electric sunshade and even a manual sunshade for the rear quarter glass (reference image).
BMW finally has an answer to the legroom of the E-Class. With the seat adjusted to my driving position (I’m 5’10” tall), I had enough legroom. You can always have the front seat pushed all the way forward to actually stretch your legs. Have to admit, there is a bit more room here than in the E-Class (reference image).
Nice and soft cushions have been provided for additional comfort.
The centre armrest gets a wireless charging pad. The base extends forward to expose two cupholders.
Rear passengers get a wide centre armrest which has a small storage bin underneath.
There is a provision behind the front seats for accessories. This is an iPad holder. You can also have a coat hanger here.
The 5 Series has 4-zone climate control. There is a mobile holder at the bottom.
Boot space is 500 litres. You get a low boot lip and flat loading bay.
Space saver spare wheel is placed under the boot floor. There’s some additional storage area here as well.

Driving the BMW 5 Series 2.0L Turbo Petrol AT
Powering the BMW 530Li  is a 2.0-litre, 4-cylinder petrol engine that makes 255 BHP @ 4,500 – 6,500 rpm and 400 Nm @ 1,600 – 4,600 rpm. It is mated to an 8-speed transmission which sends power to the rear wheels.
This is the only powertrain on offer with the 5 Series and it is actually disappointing that there is no 6-cylinder available. In particular, there is no 530d which was an iconic nameplate. There is a 540i, 6-cylinder petrol on sale internationally, and hopefully, BMW will get that to India for enthusiasts. Compared to the 4-cylinder engine from the previous generation, this engine makes more 7 BHP & 50 Nm more. It features the same BMW TwinPower Turbo tech and an exhaust manifold that is integrated into the cylinder head. The engine also features a 48V Electrical Motor with a power output of 11 BHP and 25 Nm of torque. The 8-speed ZF Steptronic transmission sends power to the rear wheels.
Moving on from all the technical jargon to driving the car. It gets off the line pretty smoothly and without much drama. Start driving in the city and the engine gearbox combination will impress you with its smoothness. With a light foot on the throttle, you can barely feel the shifts and the driving experience is quite pleasant for you and the passengers. You can keep up with traffic easily and close the gaps without much effort. For most of the driving conditions in the city, part throttle inputs should be enough. There are 2 settings for the engine mapping on the 5 Series – Comfort and Sport. I do feel that the Eco mode in the Mercedes E200 was a tad smoother. Measuring 5,175 mm in length, the 5 Series is a long car, but it is pretty manoeuvrable in the city traffic.
Out on the highway is where you can experience the entire rev range. Right off the bat, this is a fantastic engine and gearbox combination. For a 4-cylinder, it has a good amount of grunt and responsiveness. The power comes in early and you don’t have to wait for it. It’s instant and the gearbox is also responsive enough to be in the right gear so that the car is ready to go. With your foot flat on the floor, the revs climb quickly and the shifts are also on point. The car also has a launch control mode or the Sport Boost function which will ready the car for a launch. This is activated by pulling and holding the left paddle shifter. You will be taken to the launch screen on the MID.
It is worth noting that given the extra length and additional weight, the G68 5 Series is slower in the 0-100 km/h sprint than the previous generation car. While the previous generation 5 Series did 0-100 km/h in 6.1 seconds, the new car is 4 tenths slower. The standard wheelbase version which is available in international markets is quicker by 2 tenths of a second (5.9 seconds). Keeping the numbers aside, the car is still fast and you won’t feel much of a difference unless you are a Formula 1 driver.
What you will be doing in the 5 Series from time to time is cruising on the highway. The engine spins quietly at 1,400 rpm at 100 km/h and at 1,600 rpm at 120 km/h (both in D8). Want to make a quick overtake, just floor the A-pedal and the transmission drops down the gears and off you go! There’s not much delay and the gearbox responds quickly. You can also manually downshift using the paddle shifters which are very responsive as well. There’s also the transmission's ‘S’ mode that you can engage for aggressive shifts. It does make a difference as the transmission holds on to gears longer in this mode. Using paddle shifters in the S mode gives you full manual control of the gearbox and it doesn’t upshift on its own. You can use the entire rev range in this mode.
BMW 5 Series gets a bunch of modes all of which are not specifically meant to alter the driving characteristics. Certain modes alter other characteristics like the sunshade, ambient lighting etc. The mode which makes a difference to the driving characteristics is the Sport mode because in this mode you can select certain aspects of the car. You have Comfort and Sport mode for the engine map. Then you have the Sport mode for the dynamics of the car in which you can switch off the traction control to have some fun and you have the Comfort and Sport settings for the steering as well. There is a noticeable difference, but I feel that BMW has unnecessarily complicated a fairly straightforward ‘Drive Modes’ feature.

Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH)
While driving around in the city, the engine is quiet and the overall cabin experience is very silent. The damping is impressive for a silent driving experience. When you rev the car, the engine note is nice and enjoyable. It does feel a bit muted though thanks to the solid damping of the cabin. If you want to hear more of the engine noise, engage the S mode and you’re sorted. The engine noise is louder and something that the enthusiasts will enjoy. But wait! This is trickery on BMW’s part. The exhaust note is actually amplified through the speakers in S mode and it is very convincing. The ‘fake’ engine sound actually sounds great inside the cabin.
The wind and road noise are very well controlled at 100-120 km/h. On the other hand, the speed alert chime at 120 km/h is very annoying. What’s worse is that the music volume gets muted and you can’t do anything about the chime. I’m sure some tuners will quickly find a way to remove this chime.

Mileage & Fuel economy
There is an efficient mode that switches on the idling start-stop system. It is quite aggressive and turns off the engine even when in bumper-to-bumper traffic which can get annoying. The claimed fuel efficiency of the 530 Li is 15.7 km/l which will go out the window when you have some fun with the car. The 5 Series also features  Brake-Energy Regeneration which recovers energy during deceleration.
The fuel tank capacity is 60 litres and just like the E200, the 5 Series is E5, E10 and E25 compatible.

Suspension & Ride Comfort
Given that the 5 Series is a long wheelbase sedan and going up against the E-Class, we had an idea that the focus would be on comfort and that’s exactly the case. In fact, the suspension tune is very similar to the E-Class, which also focuses on ride comfort. In the city, at slow speeds, the suspension feels absorbent. You don’t have to be excessively careful over bad roads, just be mindful that this is a German sedan and you’ll be fine. The softly sprung suspension also means that there is side-to-side movement in the cabin over bad roads. The 18-inch wheels are also a contributor to the nice ride quality. There’s enough tyre sidewall height and the suspension is comfort-oriented. The ride is very absorbent and does a fabulous job of cushioning on imperfect suburban roads. The ride gets flatter as you gather speed. Over road undulations at high speeds, there is vertical movement. It’s still controlled and doesn’t feel excessive.
This is a long wheelbase sedan with a soft suspension, so it’s best if you are careful over speed breakers (especially if you have 4 people and luggage in the car). In this picture, there is no load.

Handling & Dynamics
As you expect from a German sedan, the high-speed stability is good. On smooth roads, you can cruise at triple-digit speeds effortlessly. Also given the refinement, long journeys should be more comfortable as well. The 225/55 R18 Vredestein Ultrac Vorti tyres provide good grip around the corners.
Unlike the previous generation, this generation of 5 Series is not a handler. You don’t want to be attacking corners with this. It’ll manage to hold its line, but you can feel the roll and the softness of the suspension which will hold you back.
Even as an enthusiast, GTO has a counter-view. He thinks this is the best kind of suspension for India. Yes, it’s not as sharp a handler as the outgoing 5 series, but there’s still enough grip for you to have a decent amount of fun. It’s only about 5% of the time you’ll be enjoying the previous generation’s handling advantage. The other 95% of the time that you’re driving in a normal manner on typical roads, you will appreciate the ride comfort of the G68 5 Series a lot more.

Steering
The chunky M steering is fantastic to hold. For an EPS, it is quite light and direct. It does feel connected when in the corners and is not vague. In Sport mode, it weighs up a bit and adds to the confidence in corners.

Braking
The all-wheel disc brakes perform very well. There’s a good bite and sharp response to pedal input and it feels progressive. Emergency braking situations are also handled well.
