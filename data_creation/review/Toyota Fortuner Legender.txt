2021 Toyota Fortuner Review
The
Toyota Fortuner Facelift has been launched in India at a price of between Rs. 29.98 - 37.58 lakhs (ex-Delhi).

Toyota Fortuner Pros.
Fantastic 2.8L diesel engine has gotten even better. More power, more responsive!
Smooth and competent 6-speed automatic gearbox
Contemporary styling & imposing street presence
Tough build. Toyota body-on-frame UVs are known to have very long lives (400,000+ km is realistic)
Smooth petrol also available, if you want more refinement and / or are from Delhi-NCR
Features such as Quad-LED headlamps, powered tailgate, wireless smartphone charging, ventilated seats & more
Impressive offroad capability (by big SUV standards) is superior to its direct competitors
Top-notch safety kit. 7 airbags, ESP, TC, hill assist, ISOFIX & 3-point seatbelts for all
Outstanding long term reliability. And you get great resale value as well
Toyota's excellent after-sales quality, fuss-free ownership experiences, low service costs & up to 7 years of extended warranty coverage

Toyota Fortuner Cons.
The already-expensive Fortuner has gotten even more expensive! Top variants cost 45-lakhs OTR
Legender variant has many limitations (no MT, no petrol, no colour options, no 11-speaker sound system)
Firm & bumpy ride quality. Bad roads in the city are prominently felt inside
Heavy steering at low speeds will bother you
Lots of body roll. Go easy on the curves
Missing sunroof, lumbar adjustment, auto-wipers, TPMS, adaptive parking guidelines etc.
6-speaker sound system is terrible for a 40-lakh rupee car!
Cost-cutting evident in a couple of areas; some interior plastics, ICE audio quality, camera display…
Fortuner's petrol variant is a guzzler. We've seen merely 6 – 7 kmpl on the AT
No longer a full-time 4x4 like the 1st-gen car. Also, 4x4 carries a Rs. 3 lakh OTR premium

Introduction
Why fix what's not broken? The second-generation Toyota Fortuner - one of the best-selling SUVs in the D2 segment, has received a facelift around 4 years after it was launched. It has been consistently out-selling its main rival, the Ford Endeavour. No vehicle from any other manufacturer has even come close to challenging the big Toyota, let alone toppling it from the top of the sales charts.
The Fortuner has created a name for itself owing to its capabilities, butch road presence, powertrains, features offered and Toyota's legendary reliability + longevity + resale. In fact, when the Fortuner facelift was launched, there was a strike in the Toyota plant and production had slowed down. Even though the new cars could not reach dealerships for prospective customers to take a look at, bookings for the Fortuner facelift crossed the 5,000 mark
in February 2021. One should also consider the price of the vehicle - the updated Fortuner now costs between Rs. 29.98 lakhs and Rs. 37.43 lakhs (ex-showroom Delhi), which is significantly higher than when it was first launched and also more expensive than the Endeavour. Such is the demand and following that the SUV commands.
While the Endeavour has taken a step back by downsizing its engine and deleting a few features, the Fortuner gets an even more powerful engine along with more features!! Such smart thinking is just one of the many reasons that the Fortuner outsells the Endeavour.
Along with the facelift, Toyota has introduced a new variant of the Fortuner called the Legender. This variant comes with a slightly different exterior and some more features that help it stand apart from the regular Fortuner. Priced at Rs. 37.58 lakhs (ex-showroom Delhi), it is only available with a 2.8L diesel engine and an automatic transmission sending power to the rear wheels only and just one dual tone colour option - White Pearl Crystal Shine with Black roof. The car seems to be aimed at those who desire a little more exclusivity and don't mind paying for it. That said, it inexplicably gets a 6 speaker sound system (which is very sad) when the regular car gets JBL audio with 11 speakers.

Toyota Fortuner Legender Exterior Review
At the front, the radiator grille, headlights and the bumper have been updated. The Fortuner retains the butch road presence of the outgoing car.
Redesigned dual-tone alloy wheels are the only change in the side profile.
Just like the front, there are minor changes to the rear as well. The tail lights and the rear bumper have been changed.
Thanks to its different looks, the Legender variant will provide some exclusivity to Fortuner buyers who want to stand out from those of the regular car.
The Legender is available in only 1 dual-tone colour option - White Pearl Crystal Shine with Black roof.
The Legender variant gets quad LED headlamps with LED DRLs.
A look at the detailing on the outside of the headlamp cluster and on the inside.
A look at the headlamp cluster with all the lights in action.
Powerful quad LED headlamps illuminate the road very well.
With the high beam engaged, the throw is phenomenal!
DRLs are bright & prominent, even during the day.
Slim radiator grille gets a mesh with a glossy black strip on top and L-shaped thick glossy black strips on either side that run over the headlamp clusters.
Front bumper is new and gets a wide air dam with glossy black trim pieces and a silver skid plate. Toyota calls it "Catamaran Style front bumper".
LED front foglamps get black housings. The SUV is also equipped with a couple of front parking sensors.
The Legender variant gets sequential turn-indicators at the front, which are placed too low. This can be dangerous as they might not always be visible in the IRVM of the car ahead of you.
Indicators double up as pilot lamps.
A look at the glossy black trim pieces on the front bumper and the silver skid plate.
Legender gets aggressive-looking dual-tone 18” alloy wheels. 265/60 section Bridgestone Dueler H/T tyres are the same as the outgoing car. Tyre replacement costs of such a big 18" size will be steep.
Matte black roof is ribbed for added structural integrity. We wish a sunroof was provided as even SUVs from lower segments come with panoramic sunroofs.
Big spoiler fits nicely into the overall design, but we did not like the white + black colour combo on it.
The rear tail-lamps have been slightly reworked. Turn-indicators are repositioned.
A single aero fin has been provided on the tail lamps (the
pre-facelift Fortuner
had two). Also note how the different elements in the tail-lamp are not at one level.
A look at all the lights in action. Just like the front, the rear gets sequential turn-indicators.
The tailgate in the Legender variant is handsfree and comes with a kick sensor for opening / closing.  The thick chrome garnish with Fortuner branding on the old car has now been blacked out.
The rear bumper now comes with 4 parking sensors (old car got only 2). It gets a glossy black insert at the bottom and an L-shaped black insert on either side.
We had complained about the absence of a rear foglamp in such an expensive SUV. Toyota has now given the Fortuner rear foglamps.

Toyota Fortuner Legender Interior Review
The changes to the interior are minimal. These include minor changes to the colour scheme, and some new features. The Legender variant gets dual-tone black and maroon upholstery.
3-spoke multi-function steering wheel remains nearly the same, with minor changes to the colour scheme and the wooden trim.
Wooden insert at the top is now darker than before.
Leather-wrapped steering wheel gets red contrast stitching.
Legender gets black dials with white illumination and needles. The detailing in the instrument cluster has been reworked as well.
Nice graphics when you start the car.
The MID gets some more features including a stop watch, fuel consumption, a digital speedometer, and parking sensor warning display. It also tells you which direction the front wheels are pointing. Note that the position of the gear indicator and the outside temperature have also changed.
RHS stalk now gets a switch to operate the rear foglamps.
Buttons for the parking sensor, powered tailgate opening / closing, kick sensor for the tailgate, and the DPF regeneration are placed to the right of the steering wheel.
The doorpad gets a black and maroon theme in tune with the dashboard.
A look at the red leather insert. Also note the ambient light strip placed within the silver insert.
A look at the ambient light strip at night.
Armrest is wrapped in black leather and gets red contrast stitching.
Black and red leather seats with perforation. All variants of the Fortuner now get ventilated front seats.
A close look at the leather upholstery and the red contrast stitching.
Front passenger seat is electrically adjustable. It also gets height adjustment.
Both the footwells are illuminated in the Legender.
The SUV finally gets an auto-dimming IRVM - a feature that should have been there in the pre-facelift car as well.
The center facia gets leather inserts in the new colour, a larger touchscreen head-unit, and a new wooden insert.
A closer look at the leather insert on the side of the center fascia.
All variants get an 8.0-inch touchscreen infotainment head-unit with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. It gets physical buttons with silver inserts on either sides.
The homescreen. Touch to access audio, calls, driving information and vehicle settings. Display & graphics do look 5 years too old. Sound quality of the Legender's audio system is very sad for a 4-million rupee car. In fact, it's poorer than the ICE we have seen in some 15-lakh rupee cars.
The Fortuner comes with SmartDeviceLink, which connects your phone and its apps to the car's infotainment system.
Shockingly, still no adaptive guidelines for the reversing camera. Glaring omission in such an expensive SUV!!
All variants of the Fortuner come with connected car technology which includes features like geo-fencing, realtime vehicle tracking, and walk to car. Customers need to apply on the Carot App and provide their KYC details. It is said to take 3 days for your account to be approved.
All variants of the Fortuner now get ventilated front seats with headlamp adjuster-like controls, which look and feel out of place on a vehicle so expensive. There's a small storage space on the center console next to the controls for the ventilated seats.
Legender gets a wireless smartphone charger.
Bird's eye view of the center console. It gets a new darker wooden trim.
A close look at the detailing on the wooden trim on the center console.
Next to the handbrake are buttons to activate the 'Eco', 'Normal', and 'Sport' driving modes.
Sunvisors are not soft and actually feel like hard plastic.
Along with the buttons for the cabin lights, the Fortuner comes with a button to cancel the intrusion sensor. The sensor responds to movement inside the vehicle and triggers the alarm. It can be cancelled when you leave say, pets inside the car for a very short duration.
Rear doors also get ambient lighting strips on the silver inserts.
Fortuner" branded insert on the window kink is finished in silver. It was black in the outgoing car.
A look at the middle row bench with the black and red leather upholstery. The design and functions remain unchanged.
12V power outlet at the end of the center console has been replaced by two USB ports.
Third row seats draped in the same dual-tone upholstery as the rest of the interior.
Tailgate has a sticker showing the operation of the handsfree function.
Smartkey gets Fortuner branding at the back.

Toyota Fortuner Legender 2.8L Diesel AT Review
The Fortuner gets the same 2.8L diesel that powers the pre-facelift Fortuner. This motor uses a variable geometry turbocharger. It now produces 201 BHP (@ 3,400 rpm) and 500 Nm of peak torque starting at a low 1,600 rpm (held till 2,800 rpm), which is 26 horses and 50 Nm up on the old Fortuner. Thanks to the hike in power, this new engine is even better now. It is more eager and the throttle response is really nice and sharp.
Like before, Toyota has equipped the Fortuner with driving modes. These include Normal, Economy and Sport. The Sport mode was called Power mode in the outgoing car. The Normal mode now gets a separate button to engage it. This is a superb way of customising the engine / throttle behaviour for prevailing driving conditions.
Normal mode: If neither of the two (eco or sport) modes is selected, the Fortuner's engine runs in normal mode. This is a balance between economy & power.
Eco mode: Press the ECO button on the center console and the power delivery is lower, with the throttle response dulled a bit. That said, because the engine is big & powerful, ECO mode is very useable in the city. It doesn't feel sluggish at all and there is more than enough grunt on tap to keep up with traffic. On a lighter note, having ECO mode on a big 2.8 diesel is in itself a contradiction.
Sport mode: Engage Sport mode and you'll feel the throttle to be sharper. The engine is very, very responsive in this driving mode. Acceleration times also noticeably improve.
The Fortuner Automatic doesn't use a fancy dual-clutch transmission. Instead, a simple old school torque-converter unit does the job. It has proven to be super reliable too. The Fortuner AT isn't going to wow you with lightning fast shifts or super smart logic, yet it will take you from point A to B in extreme convenience. The AT doesn't leave much room for complaint, but it doesn't give you anything to write home about either.
Press the brake pedal & hit the engine start button to fire her up. The AT's gear shifter is calm and composed. It remains that way on the move. However, on startup, the car suffers cabin shake. At idle, the big 2.8L diesel is audible on the outside, but shut the door & windows and the noise goes away. Cabin insulation is very good. Outside noise stays outside (note: engine noise is audible at higher revs).
Thanks to the torque converter, the way the vehicle moves from a standstill is smooth & seamless. In bumper to bumper traffic, the transmission's creep makes the Fortuner crawl at 8 km/h (without accelerator input). You can drive with just your foot on the brake pedal through bottlenecks. Peak torque is developed early @ 1,600 rpm, thus there's very little lag to speak of in the AT. Even at low rpms, the throttle is responsive. With a light foot in the city, upshifts happen at as low as ~1,500 rpm! This helps you cruise around with smooth shifts & low engine sound. The AT is keen to upshift and will quickly make its way up the ladder - at times, you'll see upshifts happening as soon as you take your foot off the accelerator (uncool for people like us who like engine braking). This is a big & powerful diesel, hence you don't need to give it heavy revs within the city. Soft inputs work best for normal commuting. However, press the accelerator halfway in and shift quality definitely becomes perceptible. While the gearbox is still overall smooth, it's not an absolutely seamless shifting experience above 2,000 rpm. You'll know when the shifts are taking place. The engine & gearbox are also very responsive to throttle input. Some owners might feel that they are in fact too responsive! Even in normal mode, the engine revvs with a slight tap on the pedal. This is why you'll see the 2.8L revving unnecessarily when shifting between the lower gears. Solution? Eco mode.
On Team-BHP, we don't usually recommend driving around in ECO, yet for the city, we'll make an exception with the Fortuner AT. Because of the dulled throttle response, the driving experience is smoothest in ECO. This is the mode you have to use within the city and - as mentioned before - it's still quick enough. Sport mode for your daily commute? Fellow passengers will find it too jerky as the throttle is damn sharp. Drive around town in ECO mode and the experience is calm.
On the open road, the Fortuner AT is a fast SUV. The engine remains responsive above 2,500 rpm. Because of its big engine and the power on tap, you'll never be left wanting for punch. Also, sport mode does bring an enhanced sense of urgency to the engine (although normal & ECO are useable on the highway too). The Fortuner AT can be a lively intercity express. In kickdown, upshifts take place in the vicinity of 4,000 rpm. Don't drive it in a pedal to the metal style though. Rather, you should build up speed gradually, else you'll get a lot of noise as the engine revvs & the gearbox drops a gear (more on NVH later, but it makes quite a racket for a premium SUV). Best part about the car is its cruising ability. Thanks to the tall 6th gear, 100 km/h comes in at merely ~1,500 rpm. At this point, engine noise is virtually absent. The Fortuner AT is a very calm long distance cruiser. Overtaking doesn't pose a problem at all. There's ample power and you have a great view of the road ahead. However, the 6-speed has that conventional AT lag (~1 second) between your putting the foot down and the gearbox downshifting. After that, she pulls away nicely. I did face one problem at high speeds here - due to conservative tuning and limited revs, at times if you jump out of the lane and want to overtake, the gearbox drops just one gear when you wish it had dropped two. The downshift logic isn't aggressive and you'll need to be patient in such a situation. Thus, on two-lane highways where you need to make quick moves, I'd recommend Sport mode. It'll give you more punch. Another option is to prepare the car for overtaking (via a downshift using the paddle shifters) before the actual move. Overall, the gearbox logic is good. It is smooth, responds well to accelerator input and when driving hard, it knows when to hold on to gears as well.
These paddle shifters are of good quality and very well placed, making them convenient to operate. However, at times, there is a noticeable lag with the paddle shifts  the actual gear change happens so late (1+ second) that you cant really depend on them. The only time you should use manual mode is for overtaking and when you need the additional engine braking (say, going downhill). Other than that, I don't see anyone playing with the manual mode in a big, fat SUV. Further, manual mode is tuned conservatively. It won't allow aggressive downshifts where the resultant rpm would be too high, thus you can't entirely rely on it for engine braking when running down a ghat.
The Fortuner's S mode is very funny. Actually, it's not an S mode at all. Remember the D2 / D3 / D4 positions on older ATs which denote the max gear you are allowing it to shift up to? That's exactly what the Fortuner AT does in 'S' mode. As an example, move the lever to S and you'll see S4 on the instrument cluster chosen by default. This doesn't mean that the current gear is no.4. Rather, that's the topmost gear that the AT will drive in. It will remain between 1 - 4. You can similarly choose to restrict the AT to 3rd; drive at 4,500 rpm all day long and the box won't upshift. This is unlike proper 'S' modes which move up the shift points and give the gearbox a more aggressive nature. No such thing here, Sport mode doesnt necessarily result in a lower gear for every situation. The problem is, the layman won't realise this. He'll select 'S' mode thinking it's quicker and see 120 km/h at higher revvs in 4th (as S4 is chosen by default). Many people won't even know what they are supposed to do for easier cruising. Only an enthusiast will manually shift up to S5. This feature is very useful while off-roading but it is quite stupid for an SUV that is going to be used primarily on-road, especially in the 2WD variants.
Paddles shifters work just like the S mode - they set the highest gear that the gearbox will use. If you use the paddle shifter on the road, the only way to get back to full auto mode is to move the gear shifter to the right to S mode and then to D. This car should have paddle shifters that work the conventional way in 4X2 mode.
Those looking for a real 'sport' mode can keep the gear lever in D, but select the engine's Sport mode. The real S isn't on the gear shifter...it's on the center console!
In terms of NVH, at idle, the diesel is audible on the outside, but shut the doors & windows and the cabin is sufficiently insulated from that sound. At city rpms (2,000 rpm & under), engine noise is under control. Even above that, the 2.8L emanates more of a 'hum' rather than a 'clatter'. It's a typical big diesel hum that you won't see in smaller engines. Over 3,000 rpm however, the engine does get noisy. And it's not got a nice note. Where the now discontinued Endeavour 3.2L sounded sweet, the Fortuner is too utilitarian. Take the revv needle to 4,000 rpm and the diesel gets awfully loud. Passengers will ask you to back off.
Due to the heavy kerb weight, large engine size & AT, don't expect FE to be high. Depending on traffic conditions and how happy your right foot is, you can expect anywhere between 7 - 10 km/l (tops) in the city. On the highway, figures should be more respectable, thanks to the 6th gear & low cruising rpms. An ECO light comes on in the instrument cluster when the car is being driven economically.
There is no replacement for displacement. The Endeavour took a step back by dropping its 3.2L in favour of the smaller 2.0L turbo. The Fortuner's 2.8L has always been a fantastic engine and now they have given it more power. Its a phenomenal, fantastic engine and far superior to the Endeavour's motor.
When the idling stop system kicks in, you'll see this green indicator in the MID.
To meet BS6 emission norms, the Fortuner diesel is equipped with a Diesel Particulate Filter system. The device is designed to remove diesel particulate matter from the exhaust gas.
The button for manual regeneration of the DPF is placed to the right of the steering wheel. Regeneration burns off the accumulated soot from the filter.
Adblue filler is placed in the engine bay.

Ride & Handling
The Fortuner comes with a double-wishbone front suspension and a 4-link solid-axle rear. On uneven tarmac, the car does feel jiggly, and even small bumps & undulations make themselves felt inside the cabin. It rides like a typical body-on-frame UV, and sharp bumps come in strong. Some of this is definitely down to the 18 rim size. While the suspension goes about its business silently, it will always let you know what kind of road you are travelling on. As the speed increases, absorption levels get better. The suspension is set up on the firmer side and that helps its highway ride quality. She doesnt bounce about on undulating roads. At speed, you wont even be slowing down for broken roads. Still, highway comfort levels arent what wed call great. For instance, joints on the expressway are transmitted inside the cabin. Overall, well say that shes liveable, but not plush at all. GTO says that the Fortuner's ride quality is one of the biggest deal-breakers for him. Ride comfort is an area where the soft Ford Endeavour demolishes the Fortuner.
On the move, the Fortuner feels very sturdy. Straight line stability is very good and this Toyota stays composed at high speed. Crosswinds don't seem to affect it either. Take corners and youll feel the body roll. You have to remember this is a tall body-on-frame vehicle and be conservative while tackling curves. Its definitely no corner-carver like some monocoque SUVs and shouldnt be thrown around on winding country roads. Be mindful of its height & weight. To their credit, the 265 mm tyres provide a healthy amount of grip. All variants of the Fortuner get ESP / VSC which can be a life-saver in an emergency manouveur. Newbies will also appreciate the hill start assist feature which holds the car in place on inclines. It prevents rollback in stop & go traffic. The 4WD variants are further equipped with downhill assist control.
The Fortuners steering is hydraulically assisted. It is heavy at parking or crawling speeds. This means parking the large SUV into a tight spot will require a good deal of effort; those who are used to modern EPS systems will inevitably complain. Once the speedometer needle climbs, the steering does feel easier to operate. It also offers sufficient weight on the highway.
The 5.8 m turning radius is large, yet par for the course in a UV of this size. You will be making 3-point turns more often than not. Additionally, the steering takes ~3 1/4 turns from lock to lock. Piloting such large SUVs isnt easy in narrow and crowded areas.
The Fortuner diesel is equipped with 'pitch & bounce' control (also seen in the Prius & Innova Crysta). Toyota says that the system ensures a smoother ride by using engine torque to suppress any pitching & bouncing motion caused by road conditions or driver input.

Toyota Fortuner Facelift
The facelift gets minor exterior changes. Unlike the Legender, the facelift is available only in single-tone body colours. This one is finished in Super White.
The LED headlights get reworked internals with LED DRLs.
The facelift retains the outgoing car's trapezoidal grille but gets new mesh detailing.
Redesigned front bumper houses a silver skid plate and foglamps. Just like in the Legender, the parking lights, which also double up as turn-indicators, are placed low down in the front bumper.
Foglamps get black surrounds with honeycomb mesh detailing.
Two front parking sensors provided. There's one on each foglamp housing.
RWD variants of the facelift get dual-tone 17 alloy wheels shod with 265/65 section A/T tyres. Toyota has continued with the mix up that was seen in the pre-facelift car. Taller sidewalls compared to the 4x4 variants means that the RWD variants will offer better ride quality.
The tail-lamps are identical to the ones seen on the Legender.
The facelift retains the chrome bar with the Fortuner branding of the outgoing car (Legender has this blackened).
Rear foglamps are provided on the standard car as well.
The facelift gets the option of Black or Chamois interior in certain variants. Here's a look at the black interior.
Black leather-wrapped steering wheel gets a darker coloured wooden insert and white contrast stitching.
Instrument cluster features blue dials with silver borders and white needles.
Front doorpads get black leather upholstery. IMHO, it looks better than the brown colour on the pre-facelift SUV.
Ventilated front seats are wrapped in black leather upholstery with perforation.
A closer look at the leather upholstery and the white contrast stitching.
No cupholders in the center console in this diesel 4x2 MT variant. It gets a larger storage space at the base of the center facia.
Buttons for the traction control and iMT on the centre console. iMT reduces jerks during gear shifts in the manual variant. This segment-first feature is basically revv-matching. iMT automatically  increases or decreases the engine revvs according to gearshifts, so  that shifting remains a jerk-free experience.
4X4 variant of the Fortuner facelift finished in Sparkling Black Crystal Shine.
4x4 variants get single tone 18-inch alloy wheels shod with 265/60 H/T tyres.
4x2 diesel AT and 4x4 diesel variants get an option of a Chamois interior colour scheme.
A look at the doorpads and the seats in the variant equipped with the Chamois scheme.
4x4 diesel variants get an 11-speaker JBL sound system, which includes 2 speakers placed in each of the front doors, tweeters placed on the dashboard, which looks aftermarket, tweeters on the front doors, a speaker in each of the rear doors, and a subwoofer in the boot.
