Introduction
Lexus India is changing gears. The company is now chasing sales numbers. Although it does not publicise any sales figures (surprisingly, not many members have asked either), it claims that it will sell as many vehicles in the first quarter of this year as it sold in the whole of last year. The ES constitutes the highest sales of the Lexus model line-up. The first-gen NX added substantial volumes to Lexus sales numbers as well. Our market, like many others across the world, is now dominated by SUVs. Since 2014 when the NX was launched in global markets, it has registered over 1 million unit sales. No wonder Lexus is betting so much on this new launch!
The first-gen Lexus NX was launched in India in December 2017. The vehicle competed with the Audi Q5, BMW X3, Mercedes GLC-Class and Volvo XC60. Lexus had loaded the car with features and despite being a CBU with a hybrid powertrain, it was priced competitively. Now, the company has launched the second-gen NX in India. The new car is improved over the first-gen vehicle in almost every area and at the same time, it retains the traditional Lexus traits of reliability, quality and longevity. We get the new NX 350h in three variants, but with only one engine option currently - a 2.5L, 4-cylinder, naturally aspirated petrol engine coupled with an electric motor and a continuously variable transmission.
The second generation NX uses the Global ArchitectureK or GA-K platform, which is a newer and modern platform designed for use in mid-size luxury vehicles. It shares the same base as the ES, but features a strengthened engine subframe, stronger B-pillar & improved engine bay beams.
On the inside, it gets a 14" touchscreen infotainment head-unit, which is much faster than the previous generation. It works like a smart tablet, with no lags. Unfortunately, though, it gets only wired Apple Car Play and Android Auto, which is a bit of a disappointment.
In the Luxury and F-sport variants, a Mark Levinson audiophile-grade music system with 17 speakers and an 1800W digital amplifier with 12 channels is standard. It incorporates Quantum Logic Surround (QLS) technology, which improves clarity and staging. Along with Clari-Fi 2.0, which recreates lost audio from reduced-quality files. The overall clarity and immersiveness were astounding. It compares or beats the optional audio equipment found in BMW (Bowers & Wilkins) & Mercedes (Burmester) CBUs from a much higher segment. Comparable base systems in CKD cars from Euro manufacturers are far behind. If someone appreciates good audio quality, it will be worth considering the higher variant just for this reason. Otherwise, the base variant is pretty loaded.
In terms of Driver Assistance & Safety, the NX 350h is loaded with features.
The India-spec car gets a pre-collision system, which is only a buzzer warning. In other countries, the car can apply brakes too. I will support this implementation from my own experience with Mercedes. These systems are too sensitive for our traffic conditions. The moment a human or live animal approaches, the car brakes very hard. This has led to some scary moments. As a rule, I switch this feature off from the console.
Like other Lexus models, the NX gets dynamic radar cruise control but with LSS+ 3 (enhanced range). This is a helpful feature over the regular cruise as the car follows the vehicle in front of you. Lane departure alert and lane tracing assist are also available. Though I am unsure of the usefulness of these features, highways are improving, and we will find these practical in coming years.
The rear cross-traffic alert function detects vehicles approaching from the side at the rear & alerts the driver with a buzzer, a linked display and an indicator located in the ORVM. The rear camera detection function detects pedestrians at the rear of the vehicle and alerts the driver with an indicator and a buzzer.
The panoramic view monitor displays a composite image from cameras installed at the front, the ORVMs, and the rear onto the touchscreen head-unit, showing the car in bird's eye view when driving at slow speeds. There's also an underfloor view that displays an undercarriage image of the vehicle and allows the driver to see beneath the car from the driver's seat. This supports the driver in checking for safety around the car and possibly the safety of small animals resting under your car. The driver can select different views by pressing the camera button.
During lane changes, the blind spot monitor uses millimetre-wave radar to detect vehicles present in the blind spots (areas in adjacent lanes that cannot be seen using the ORVMs) and alerts the driver using an indicator in the ORVM.
The Lexus NX has a five star Euro NCAP rating.

Exterior
The NX is available in three trims, Exquisite, Luxury and F Sport. While the Luxury and Exquisite variants look similar. We drove the F Sport, which gets a different radiator grille and alloy wheels.
Front end is dominated by a large radiator grille with a new U-shaped patterns at the front giving a three-dimensional look. It is flanked by LED headlights and L-shaped LED DRLs.
Rear appearance is broad with bulging wheel arches. A light bar runs across the tailgate connecting the two LED taillamps.
Side profile has a lot of sharp edges and curved surfaces, creating three-dimensional facets. Character lines starts from the front fender, running along the side, before splitting at the rear door and wrapping around the tailgate.
Front track is 35 mm wider & rear track is 55 mm wider compared to the outgoing model. The car measures 4,660 mm in length, 1,865 mm in width and 1,670mm in height. Long overhangs restrict the offroading ability of the NX.
2nd-gen NX is built on the GA-K platform. Build quality and fit & finish are top class.
3-eye bi-beam LED headlights, with auto-levelling system and L-shaped DRLs. They feature fade-in illumination control which allows for seamless transitions when the headlights are turned on or off.
Updated spindle grille has larger openings at the bottom to aid cooling. This new design will be gradually be used in the other models too. Personally, I liked the grille on the Luxury & Exquisite variants more. Front bumper gets a silver skid plate.
Front camera is neatly placed under the "L" logo.
Foglamps are separate from cornering lamps. They are placed low on the bumper.
Full underbody protection has been provided.
Long bonnet features prominent creases, which give it a muscular appearance.
F Sport badge on both the front fenders depicts the variant.
ORVMs get cameras underneath which are essential for the 360-degree camera system. All variants get a blind spot monitor system as well.
Dual-tone (glossy black and body coloured) door handles are fixed.
This is the first Lexus model to be fitted with an E-Latch electronic locking system. To open the door, touch the sensor on the inside of the fixed handle and pull.
F Sport variant gets 20" black alloy wheels with 235/50 section run flat tyres. I like the wheel design on the Luxury variant more.
Panoramic sunroof is fairly sized. It gets UV and IR cut glass.
Sharkfin antenna sits at the rear.
Tailgate gets a subtle and neatly integrated spoiler.
Blade LED tail-lamps have been adopted from the UX and feature L-shaped pilot lamps. Rear light bar is constantly illuminated at night to function as a tail-lamp.
Tailgate gets many cuts and creases with big "L E X U S" lettering. Model and AWD badges sit low on the right side.
Dual-tone rear bumper gets a silver insert.
Single exhaust pipe on either side.
Rear electric motor is mounted on the rear axle.

Interior
F Sport comes with either an all-black or a black & white or this black & flare red dual-tone interior theme. Soft-touch materials have been used at various places, along with black piano inserts. The quality of materials used is mostly higher than what others in this segment offer, and  the cabin looks and feels very premium.
Sports steering with perforated leather, contrast red stitching and aluminium inserts is the perfect size and feels great to hold. It gets heating function and paddles behind.
Unlike most Asian cars, light stalk is located on the left while the wiper stalk is placed on the right. As expected of a car in this segment, auto wipers and headlamps are standard.
Switch for the automatic (intelligent) high beam function is located on the edge of the light stalk.
Black engine start/stop button is placed to the left of the steering wheel, on the upper left corner of the touchscreen head-unit.
Fully digital instrument cluster is easy to read. In Sport S+ driving mode, it features a racing layout.
Colour head-up display projects driving information in the driver's field of view on the windshield glass.
Switches to adjust the illumination adjustment and toggle between the odometer and trip meter are located on the right side of the steering wheel, next to the air-con vent.
Doorpads are black with red contrast stitching, red leather cladding on the armrest and dark spin aluminium inserts.
E-Latch electronic locking system features a switch that needs to be pushed to open the door.
Luxury & F Sport variants get a 17-speaker Mark Levinson sound system.
F Sport leather upholstered front seats are wide & super comfy. Theres good under-thigh support, and the side bolstering keeps you in place when cornering on twisty roads. All variants get ventilated front seats. F Sport variant gets headrests with vertical as well as front-back adjustment.
Electrically adjustable driver's seat with lumbar support. Gets memory function as well.
Passenger seat is electrically adjustable too. However, it does not get lumbar adjustment or memory function.
A close look at the perforated leather seat upholstery. Ventilation function is standard on front seats. The quality of materials used is very good.
Centre armrest is wrapped in leather and very usable. It is not adjustable but comfortably for both front seat occupants. It is set at the height of armrests on the door pads. This is claimed to lessen driving fatigue.
Aluminium pedals look super sporty! Dead pedal is of a good size and comfortable to use.
Rearward visibility is restricted due to thick C-pillars and a small windshield.
Notice the Centre fascia tilted towards the driver (inspired by BMW?).
14-inch touchscreen head-unit is easy to use with no lag. Music is played through 17 speakers and sound quality is outstanding.
Various setting can be changed via the touchscreen.
A host of driving information is can be displayed.
Flow of charge / power is displayed.
Touchscreen doubles up as a display for the reversing camera.
360-degree camera displays good footage on the screen.
The climate control system gets touch controls and rotary knobs for adjusting the temperature. In addition, the system gets a clean air filter with a minus ion generator (Nano-E).
Type C and Type-A USB ports are located below the air-con vents. Rotary switch for selecting the drive modes is placed on the right. Notice its resemblance to the Porsche sports chrono dial. The F Sport variant we drove gets 4 preset drive modes - Eco, Normal, Sport S and Sport S+.
Wireless smartphone charger is on a plastic sliding door.
No need to remove your smartphone if you want to access the storage bin below the charger. There is enough room above the sliding door. Cubby hole to store small items has been provided above.
Storage compartment with a felt lining and 12V socket at the base of the centre fascia.
Leather-wrapped gear shifter looks and feels premium. Switches for the EV mode and traction control along with the electronic parking brake and the auto hold are located just behind the gear shifter.
Bird's eye view of the centre console. Parked next to the gear shifter are two cupholders with non-slip mats.
Beneath the centre armrest is a large storage compartment with a soft lining. What's cool is that the door is hinged on both sides, making the storage box easy for the front passenger to access too.
Glovebox is medium-sized and gets a soft lining.
Roof bezel consists of sunroof controls, airbag warning lights and touch-control reading lights. Just a soft touch and the white LEDs turn on gently.
Sunglass holder gets a soft lining on the inside.
Sunvisors feel premium in terms of touch. Both units get vanity mirrors with covers and illumination.
Large panoramic sunroof lets in a lot of light, making the cabin feel airy. This is important as the interiors have a dark theme.
Rear door pads follow the same theme as the front ones.
Ingress & egress are easy. There's enough headroom and legroom at the rear, but the under-thigh support could've been a little better. Overall, the rear bench is comfortable.
Legroom is healthy and even two 6-footers can sit one behind the other comfortably.
Centre armrest is set at the same height as the door armrests. It is wide and soft and also has two cupholders.
The rear seat has contours for support and while three 3-point seatbelts and three adjustable headrests have been provided, the rear seat is better suited for 2 adults and a kid (rather than 3 healthy adults). ISOFIX child seat mounts have been provided on both sides.
Rear air-con vents get a glossy black border. They get separate flow direction controllers and a common air volume controller.
Floor hump is wide and prominent. This coupled with the rear air-con means the middle passenger will prefer to put his feet on either side of the hump.
Handsfree powered tail-gate has been provided. Boot is well shaped and has a carrying capacity of 520 litres. You can fold down the seatbacks to increase the boot space to 1,411 litres.
No spare wheel here, which is a disadvantage on Indian roads. Multiple storage compartments have been provided under the boot floor.
Battery is placed in a dedicated compartment on the left.

Driving the Lexus NX 350h Petrol-Hybrid Automatic
The NX 350h AWD features a 4th Generation Lexus Hybrid Drive system. It is powered by a 2.5L, 4-cylinder, naturally aspirated petrol engine paired with hybrid transaxle and a rear electric motor. This setup produces 240 BHP, which is an increase of 45 BHP over the outgoing model. The car has a claimed 0–100 km/h time of 7.7 seconds and a top speed of 200 km/h. The car is expected to return a fuel-economy of 16.9 km/l. The NX 350h features a new lithium-ion hybrid battery vs a Nickel-metal hydride battery of the outgoing car. The engine is mated to an electric motor and power is transmitted to the wheels via a CVT.
Since there is no starter motor, there are no vibrations felt or start-up or shut down. The car will start in electric mode and based on the demand, the petrol engine will come on. There are also two electric motors that get power from the batteries. E-Four, which is the Lexus term for this setup, uses the motor to drive the rear wheels when starting off or driving on slippery surfaces. The front-rear power distribution is precisely controlled in ratios between 100:0 and 20:80 when starting off and aiding cornering stability. During normal driving, the rear axle is disengaged from the powertrain to maximise efficiency. Once 60% of engine power has been delivered, the rear axle starts contributing to the acceleration. Depending upon the surface, up to 80% of engine power can be sent to the rear wheels.
To start the car, put your foot on the brake pedal and press the starter button. Take your foot off the brake pedal and the vehicle starts crawling. This means you can drive the car with just the brake pedal in stop & go traffic (no need to press the accelerator).
The CVT provides a seamless experience in the city. As there aren't any actual gearshifts taking place, the drive feels butter-smooth. Forget AMTs, even torque converter & dual-clutch ATs cannot touch a CVT for smoothness. Throttle response is very good and the infamous rubber-band effect is superbly controlled, which is very unlike the previous generation car. Even when you get aggressive, the engine and transmission respond well compared to other CVTs. The light controls and smooth transmission make the NX 350h an easy car to drive in city traffic.
On the open road, the 240 BHP powertrain makes sure that the NX 350h offers very good performance. Press the accelerator and you'll soon be doing triple digit speeds. Only when one drives very aggressively that he can notice the rubber-band effect if he concentrates hard. That said, it is nowhere as bad as we have seen in cars in the past. In fact, most users will not notice it at all. Open-road performance is very satisfactory and owners will be pleased. The car can maintain triple digit speeds all day long on the expressway.

Drive Mode
Apart from the Normal driving mode, the NX 350h F Sport gets 3 preset selectable driving modes.
Eco Mode - Engage 'Eco' mode to take the engine into its most fuel-efficient mode. Frankly, because of the powerful engine, this mode is also very usable. It's not dull or dead at all, like in some other cars. Eco is the smoothest of all to use. The response time of the engine and gearbox is slower, but it's still practical & driveable. On the open road, this mode can be used while cruising on the expressway.
Sport Mode - Engaging Sport makes the car noticeably more responsive to throttle inputs. The difference is immediately felt! It also gives you the best steering weight for highway driving. Enthusiasts will love this mode & use it whenever they're in the mood for some fun. On the flip side, we found Sport to be too sharp for city traffic. It can make things jerky at times. The Eco and Normal modes are noticeably smoother.
Sport+ Mode - This mode sharpens the car's responses even further.

Suspension
The NX 350h comes with MacPherson strut suspension at the front and a double wishbone suspension at the rear. The F Sport variant gets fully adaptive shock absorbers, as well as chassis performance dampers. These are fitted to the far front and rear of the chassis.
High speed stability is of a high order. During our short drive, at triple digit speeds, the car was well-planted with no signs of nervousness at all.
Despite running on 20" wheels, the ride quality is outstanding. Small bumps and potholes are not felt inside the cabin. Even medium sized ones were absorbed well. As the speed increases, the ride gets even better. The rear passengers too, were comfortable and had nothing to complain about.
Coming to handling, body roll is well contained. We drove the car enthusiastically through twisty roads and never did it feel uneasy. The 235/50 section Bridgestone Alenza tyres on our test car provided good grip and never complained when pushed hard.
Also, a new steering system has been introduced. Instead of the electric motor being attached to the steering column, it is now located below the car, attached to the rack itself. This results in a quiet operation and much more direct steering feel. This shows in the way the car drives, it’s more like a car than an SUV.
As expected in this segment, the NX 350h gets discs all-round. The brake pedal is well calibrated and feels sharp to use. The braking is powerful and very confidence-inspiring.
To sum it up, the suspension and the drive-train are well sorted, making the NX 350h engaging to drive. It's not to BMW levels, but I can safely say better than Volvo XC60.
