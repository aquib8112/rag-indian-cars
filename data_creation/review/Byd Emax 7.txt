A well-rounded product that looks good and has decent cabin space
201 BHP motor packs a punch. Does the 0-100 km/h dash in just 8.6 seconds!
400-450 km real-world range is great; forget urban commuting, this is enough for road-tripping with the family
Both battery options (55.4 kWh & 72.8 kWh) are available with 6 and 7-seater configurations
Good low-speed ride quality, zero emissions, cheap running costs, no gears, and light controls make it an ideal city car
8-year / 1,60,000 km battery warranty, 8-year / 1,50,000 km warranty on motor, 6 years of roadside assistance
Features such as the vehicle-to-load function (A/C power for appliances), powered tailgate, panoramic glass roof, NFC key card, 12.8-inch rotating touchscreen & more
Safety features include 6 airbags, TPMS, hill-hold, 360-degree view camera, ESP and level 2 ADAS

BYD eMAX 7 Cons
At ~Rs. 30 lakh on-road, there is price overlap with the mighty Innova Crysta as well as the even mightier Innova Hycross. Also, there are cheaper 7-seater ICE rivals offering better value
Conservative exterior & interior design may not appeal to everyone. Doesn’t have a lot of standout elements
Interior quality is mediocre; seats and some plastics feel budget-grade
6-speaker sound system is ordinary at this price point. No subwoofer at 30-lakhs is surprising
Missing features such as connected car tech, a spare wheel (please buy one yourself), wireless Android Auto & Apple CarPlay, auto wipers, auto-dimming IRVM, dead pedal, sunshades, etc.
BYD's dealership & service network is currently very small
The usual EV challenges (charging infrastructure, range anxiety, setting up home charging etc.)

Introduction
We’re still in a stage where an electric 7-seater MPV sounds odd. As of now, the only electric cars on sale in India that can seat 7 people are the Mercedes Benz EQB, the EQS SUV and the Kia EV9. So, with the market wide open, BYD has decided to foray into this space with the eMax7. It’s a 6 / 7 seater electric MPV that is based on the BYD e-Platform 3.0 which is a modular platform that also underpins the Atto 3. To give you a little context, the origins of the eMax 7 can be traced back to BYD Song which was a nameplate used for a line of ICE-powered vehicles. The MPV version was named Song Max which was previewed in 2017 in China. It was powered by a 1.5-litre turbo-petrol engine and while an EV version was showcased, it never went on sale. Instead, the smaller 5-seater BYD e6 was introduced in 2021 for fleet operation. Cut to March 2024, BYD finally showcased the right-hand drive version of the Song Max EV at the Bangkok International Motor Show and now we have it in India as the eMax 7. There is a plug-in hybrid variant on sale internationally, but as of now, we only get the BEV version.
BYD has decided to bring in 2 versions of the eMax 7 – a 55.4 kWh battery with a 161 BHP motor (Premium variant) and a 71.8 kWh battery with a 201 BHP motor (Superior variant). The claimed range for both the battery options are 420 km and 530 km respectively. The car is available in 6 as well as 7-seater configurations and is loaded with features. We got to drive the top-end Superior variant in Chennai for a day, so let’s get into all the details.

BYD eMax 7 Price & Brochure
The BYD eMax 7 is available in both 6 and 7-seater options for both battery pack options. The car is priced at Rs. 26.90 lakhs for the Premium variant 6-seater version and for Rs. 60,000 more, you can have the 7-seater version. The Superior variant with the 71.8 kWh battery pack has an ex-showroom price of Rs. 29.30 lakh for the 6-seater version and like the Premium variant, the 7-seater version is available at a premium (pun-unintended) of Rs. 60,000.
As mentioned, there is no direct competition for the eMax 7 as it is the first 7-seater electric MPV in the mass market. Being the first in a segment can be a make-or-break situation for a car. Either you exploit the segment and get some good numbers or you find it difficult to convince people to buy the car. Which way will the eMax 7 go? Only time will tell. As of now though, it will face competition from IC engine cars like the Toyota Innova Hycross, Hyundai Alcazar facelift and the Kia Carens.

Running Costs
There are 2 battery pack options available with the BYD eMax 7 – 55.4 kWh and 71.8 kWh. This means that it requires approximately 55 units and 72 units, respectively for a 100% charge. The per unit cost of electricity depends on the slab that you are in & your location, but on average, it’s about Rs. 8 per unit. Hence, for a full charge at home, you will be paying Rs. 440 and Rs. 576, respectively. The claimed range for both options is 420 km and 530 km, respectively. That is however the NEDC range which is an indicated number. In real-world driving conditions, you can expect a range of 350 km for the 55.4 kWh battery pack and 450 km for the 72 kWh battery pack. Those are some decent numbers and you will end up paying Rs. 1.2-1.5 per km.

Exterior
Design & Styling
Utility and aerodynamics arent usually a combination that designers have to deal with. But that is not the case with the BYD eMax 7. The MPV is electric and hence, needs to be aerodynamic. Notably, the BYD eMax 7 is not developed as an EV from the ground up. There is an IC engine version of the same. Hence, you can see the traditional MPV design here as well. This is not necessarily bad as the car looks proportionate from different angles. In terms of size, it is comparable to the Innova Hycross. It is however not as tall, in fact, at 1,690 mm, it is shorter than the Hyundai Alcazar facelift and even the Kia Carens. While it may not seem like a big deal, it does hamper the cars road presence. There are a total of 4 colour options available  Cosmos Black (our test car), Crystal White, Harbour Grey and Quartz Blue.

Build Quality, Fit & Finish
As weve come to expect from BYD, the build quality of the eMax 7 is good. The panel gaps are consistent and there is enough heft to the doors. There is some flex in the panels, but not something to be concerned about. The paint quality is also good overall. The Cosmos Black paint shade is very reflective as you can see in the pictures.

Wheels & Tyres
The BYD eMax 7 gets 17-inch alloy wheels shod with 225/55 section tyres. Our test car was shod with Giti Control P10 tyres which are regular tyres and not EV-specific tyres. Giti is a Singapore-based brand. The recommended tyre pressure is 36 PSI all around due to the car's heavy kerb weight and to maximize the range. If youre going to be driving this MPV sedately like a point A to point B commuter, you shouldnt have any issues with these tyres. They provide decent grip and perform well under hard braking as well.

Ground Clearance
The eMax 7 has an unladen ground clearance of 170 mm which is good enough for most driving conditions in India. We even took it on some rough roads to reach the shoot location and the car didnt scrape.

Standard & Extended Warranty
The only warrant details of the BYD eMax 7 we have as of now is that the traction battery has an 8-year / 1,60,000 km warranty, while its motor & motor controller have an 8-year / 1,50,000 km warranty. The DC-DC assembly, high voltage electric control assembly and OBC have a 6-year / 1,50,000 km warranty. This is the same as the Atto 3, so we expect the standard warranty to be 3 years / 1,25,000 km. You also get 3 years of free 4G data subscription, 6 years of roadside assistance and 6 times of free labour cost maintenance on the Atto 3 and we expect the same to be offered with the eMax 7. As usual, we strongly recommend opting for the maximum warranty coverage offered.

Maintenance
EVs have comparatively lower maintenance costs than IC engine cars. The standard service interval is 12 months or 20,000 km, which is very good.

Safety
The BYD eMax 7 has not been crash-tested yet by GNCAP or BNCAP. It is equipped with safety features like 6 airbags, TPMS, ISOFIX child seat anchors, electronic stability control, traction control system, electronic brake distribution, vehicle dynamic control, hill hold control, bake disc wiping, roll movement intervention, 360-degree view system and 4 rear radar sensors. It is also equipped with level 2 ADAS (Advanced Driving Assistance System) features like automatic emergency braking, blind spot detection, door open warning, lane departure warning, lane departure prevention, adaptive front lighting, rear cross-traffic alert & brake and front and rear collision warning.
As mentioned in the BYD Atto 3 review as well, the Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) Blade battery needs special mention here as BYD claims that it is the safest battery out there. As per the claims, while undergoing nail penetration tests, the Blade battery emitted neither smoke nor fire after being penetrated and its surface temperature reached 30 to 60 degrees Celsius. Under the same conditions, a conventional LFP block battery temperature reached a dangerous 200 to 400 degrees Celsius. Also, under extreme test conditions, such as being crushed, bent, heated in a furnace to 300°C, and overcharged by 260%, the battery didnt explode or catch fire.

Interior
Cabin Design & Quality
After the funky interior of the BYD Atto 3, I was expecting something similar in the eMax 7. However, the interiors of the car are very simple and some would even call them basic. You get an all-black dashboard with brown upholstery for the seats. The design of the dashboard is very mundane with a big 12.8-inch touchscreen infotainment taking center stage. There are hard plastics in most areas of the dashboard, but you do get soft-touch plastic in the top portion of the doorpad. The overall quality of plastics is good, but not great. While some areas feel well-designed and of good quality, other parts feel budget grade - not something you would expect in a 30 lakh-rupee car.

Space & Comfort
The BYD eMax 7 is set at a nice height, which is why getting in and out of the front seats is quite easy. Its almost like a crossover rather than an MPV in this aspect. The cabin width is good and theres enough distance between the driver and front passenger. I found the front seats to be very budget-grade. There is no lumbar adjustment and the backrest is so thin that you can even feel it if someone pokes you from the back. The under-thigh support isnt great for someone as tall as me (510) and the side bolstering is just enough. Strangely, I found the front passenger side of the footwell to be a bit cramped.

Driving Position & Ergonomics
In the drivers seat, you get a good all-round view thanks to the tall windscreen and big windows. Theres also a quarter glass below the A-pillar for some added visibility. The rear visibility is obstructed by the rear headrests and its best to stick to the 360-degree view camera while reversing. The driver seat is 6-way power adjustable, while the passenger seat is 4-way adjustable. It is worth noting that the fore & aft movement of the driver seat is restricted. With my relaxed driving position, I reached the end of the travel  range and couldnt go any further back. Anyone taller than me would want his / her seat further back which is not possible here. The cushioning is on the softer side and Id have preferred it to be a bit more firm. All the controls are easy to reach and you will get used to them pretty quickly.

Cabin Storage
Theres a decent amount of storage areas in the cabin. You get regular door pockets that can hold 1-litre bottles and cupholders in the centre console. The glovebox is very average and in fact, has a restricted opening. There are two slots to keep phones on the center console. The driver armrest also has some storage underneath. While there are some storage spaces in the cabin, some additional storage areas in the centre console wouldve added to the practicality.

Air-Conditioning
We drove the BYD eMax 7 on a particularly hot day in Chennai. The air-conditioning unit managed to keep the cabin cool and comfortable. The ventilated front seats were a boon in the hot and humid climate. The eMax 7 also comes equipped with a PM2.5 air filter.

Features
Unique & Noteworthy Features
Cars in the Indian market are expected to be loaded with features and the BYD eMax 7 is loaded to the brim. The car has the vehicle-to-load feature which transforms the car into a big power bank. Some of the noteworthy features are ADAS Level 2, powered tailgate, panoramic glass roof, 360-degree view system, ventilated and powered front seats, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, LED headlamps and tail-lamps, wireless phone charging and auto up-down feature for all 4 windows. What you do miss out on is a spare wheel, rain-sensing wipers, auto-dimming IRVM, lumbar adjustment, wireless Android Auto & Apple CarPlay connectivity, connected car tech, UV-cut glass, fully digital instrument cluster, dead pedal and rear sunshades.

Audio System & Sound Quality
The 12.8-inch touchscreen infotainment system is big and has a crisp display. Theres no lag as such and jumping through different options and screens is pretty seamless. However, the interface isnt very user-friendly and finding the right function can take some time. Its paired with a 6-speaker sound system which sounds just average for the price. The audio is pretty flat and IMO, the vocals couldve been better. Playing around with the equalizer and presets doesnt make things any better.

Rear Passengers
Rear Seat Comfort & Space
Just like the front seats, getting in and out of the rear seats is quite easy. Once inside, theres good space for the passengers. We had the captain seat variant which adds to the comfort. There is enough legroom here for someone of my height. Note that the front seat movement is restricted, hence there is good space for the rear passengers. At 510, I had good space, but anyone taller would want more room here. Two 6-footers behind one another would be tight. The headroom is good here. While the floor is flat, it is high. This results in a knees-up position while being seated and hence, the under-thigh support is not good. This is not something you will appreciate on long drives. In the captain seats variant, you get individual armrests that are adjustable for height. The glass area is good and you dont feel claustrophobic here.
There are 2 ways of getting into the third-row. If its the 6-seater variant, theres enough space between the captain seats for someone to slide into the third-row. Then you can also pull the lever on the side to move the seat forward. The seat doesnt tumble fully, so it is a climb into the third-row. The third-row is strictly for the kids as the floor is too high and hence, there is very little under-thigh support. Surprisingly, there is a decent amount of legroom as the second-row isnt poking your knees. Third-row occupants get grab handles, A/C vents and even cupholders. No USB charging ports here though.

Boot Space
With all the seats up, the boot space is just 180 litres. With the third-row folded, the luggage carrying capacity can be increased to 580 litres. There is no frunk available in the BYD eMax 7.

Driving the BYD eMax 7
There are 2 battery options available in the BYD eMax 7 – a 55.4 kWh and a 71.8 kWh. The smaller battery pack is paired with a motor that makes 161 BHP, while the larger capacity battery pack gets the 201 BHP motor. Both, however, are Blade batteries which have cells that are made in a honeycomb-like structure. So, each cell serves as a structural beam to withstand force. Combined together and after placing high-strength panels on the upper and lower sides of the pack, the rigidity of the structure is increased.
Next up is the powertrain. Just like the Atto 3, the eMax 7 uses an 8-in-1 electric powertrain system. What does this mean? 8 components of the powertrain which are usually placed separately are combined into one component to optimize space and energy efficiency (also lesser cables). The components that are grouped in the powertrain are - VCU (vehicle control unit), BMS (battery management system), MCU (motor control unit), PDU (power distribution unit), DC-DC controller, on-board charger (explained earlier), drive motor and transmission.
We got to drive the 71.8 kWh battery pack with the 201 BHP motor. Start the car, shift to ‘D’ mode, take your foot off the brake pedal and the car gets off the line in the smoothest way possible. If you primarily drive around in the city, you will appreciate the smoothness of the motor. The power delivery till part throttle, is linear and predictable. No jerks from gearshifts and no engine sound means it is an extremely refined experience. Our preferred setting while driving in the city was Eco Mode as it felt adequate for keeping up with the traffic.
Floor the A pedal and you will be greeted with instant acceleration. The car is fast and the 310 Nm torque is available right from the get-go. BYD claims a 0-100 km/h time of 8.6 seconds and we don’t doubt it. You’ll definitely be ahead of most of the IC engine cars when the signal turns green and you will see some puzzled looks as to how this MPV is so quick off the line. The eMax 7 is very nimble on its feet and it doesn’t feel like a 7-seater MPV.
Out on the highway, the eMax 7 is just as good as in the city. Getting up to 80 / 100 km/h is effortless and so is maintaining speed. Want to make a quick overtake? No worries there. Just bury the accelerator pedal and you will zoom past the vehicle ahead with ease. You'll hit silly speeds effortlessly and not even realize it due to the lack of drama (engine noise, etc.). Remember that single-gear EVs don't have the higher-end punch above 120 km/h that geared turbo-petrol cars have. The top speed of the eMax 7 is limited to 180 km/h. If you drive hard, the range will drop faster.
There are 3 driving modes to choose from and these feel very gimmicky. There’s not much difference in these modes and apart from the throttle response, no other aspect changes.
Normal Mode : This is the default mode to drive in and it works well in the city as well as on the highway. It is a good balance of power and economy.
Eco Mode : When you want to extract maximum range, this is the mode to engage. The throttle response is dumbed down which results in a smoother drive. However, you never feel that the car is lacking power. There’s still enough power on tap to keep up with the traffic and make those quick overtakes. We found this mode to be the best for driving in the city.
Sport Mode : The throttle response is sharp and the car feels ready to fly. Surprisingly, the power delivery is still linear in this mode. You won’t find this mode to be jerky and can even drive around smoothly. In fact, I realized that I was in Sport mode after almost half an hour of driving in bumper-to-bumper traffic.

Regenerative Braking
BYD has kept it simple with regenerative braking. There are only 2 levels – Standard and Larger (strange name). The Standard level is smooth and I preferred having the car in this mode. The Larger level very much resembles engine braking in IC engine cars. You do get a bit of a head nod when you get off the accelerator. It’s good for driving around in the city as well as on the highways.

Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH)
Without an engine or gearbox to make any noise, the overall driving experience is silent. At 100 km/h, the tyre noise is audible. We noticed something very strange about the wind noise. On the driver side, it is well controlled up to 100 km/h. On the passenger side, however, the wind noise starts creeping in at 80 km/h and at 100 km/h, it is considerably louder than the driver side.

Range
The BYD eMax 7 has an NEDC claimed range of 530 km. This test is done on a dynamometer and does not reflect the real-world range. In real-world driving conditions, you can expect a range of ~ 400-450 km. We’ll wait for some ownership reviews for a clearer picture of the car's real-world range.

Charging
With an 80 kW DC fast charger, the eMax 7 can be charged from 0% to 80% in 37 minutes. BYD has not shared the charging times using any other charger. If you ever run out of battery, you can always contact BYD’s roadside assistance.
Powering the BYD eMax 7 is a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor that puts out 201 BHP and 310 Nm. These are the same numbers as the BYD Atto 3.
You get hydraulic struts for the bonnet. There is also insulation on the underside.
Take a look at the underbody of the car from the back and you will spot this plate with battery details. Note that this is a 400V architecture.
Suspension

Ride Comfort
The eMax 7 gets a MacPherson strut suspension at the front and a multi-link suspension at the rear. BYD has managed to get the suspension tune to be comfortable at slow speeds. The ride quality is good in the city and the suspension feels absorbent. Small to medium-sized bumps are handled quite well and you won’t find many reasons to complain while driving in the city. There is a bit of side-to-side movement in the cabin over bad roads, but that is also primarily due to the car's shape. The suspension works silently, but big potholes do register themselves in the cabin with a loud thud. You have to be careful while tackling them. The recommended tyre pressure is 36 psi which is high. You can try and drop it to ~32 psi if you’re going to be driving primarily in the city. We would recommend topping it up to 36 psi when driving on the highway.

Handling & Dynamics
Inherently you don’t expect an MPV to handle like a hatchback. You have to be aware of the ~1,900 kg kerb weight of the car and it’s best to drive this MPV sedately. In a straight line, the eMax 7 feels stable till 120 km/h as long as the roads are smooth. You will notice a fair bit of vertical movement on the highway when going over small undulations or expansion joints on flyovers. There is body roll in corners and I found myself easing off the throttle just to avoid that uncomfortable feeling. There’s not much weight at the front end of the car which means that you don’t have enough confidence when turning into a corner. Best to drive this car sedately and enjoy the comfortable driving experience.

Steering
The electric power steering is very light and easy to operate. At city speeds, you will appreciate how easy it is to maneuver this MPV with its light steering. It weighs up when you get up to highway speeds, but not by much. A little more heft would’ve been nice for highway driving. It doesn’t feel very connected, so its not something enthusiasts will look forward to.

Braking
The eMax 7 gets ventilated discs at the front and solid discs at the rear. The stopping power is good and eMax 7 sheds speed effectively. There is some nose dive under heavy braking but its within expected levels. The brake pedal feels very linear which isn’t something we would expect in an electric car.

BYD eMax 7 Exterior Images
BYD calls the front "Dragon Face Design". Honestly, I dont see the dragon aspect here. The face is very European and sleek. In fact, it does look very similar to the Atto 3. The chrome elements at the bottom look out of place, but otherwise, this is a nice and clean look.
As is the norm these days, the tail-lights are connected. The rear end is boxy to an extent with Audi Q7-like tail-lamps.
In the side profile, the eMax 7 looks sleek and aerodynamic. In fact, it does look very similar to the Mahindra Marazzo. As you can see, the approach and departure angles arent meant for off-roading. The approach angle is 15 degrees and the departure angle is 17 degrees.
The overall build quality of the car is satisfactory and we found the panel gaps to be consistent. The car looks nice in person, but the excessive use of chrome and brushed silver might put off some people.
The eMax 7 measures 4,710 mm in length, 1,810 mm in width and 1,690 mm in height. It has a wheelbase of 2,800 mm. The front and rear tracks are 1,540 mm and 1,530 mm respectively.
Both variants get crystal-diamond floating LED headlamps with integrated LED DRLs. The superior variant gets intelligent high-beam control. As you can see, there are 5 pods in the headlamp. The outer 3 pods are for low beam and the inner 2 pods are for high beam.
The front camera is placed on the bumper right above the number plate and is quite exposed. It couldve been placed under the front grille for some protection as this is very easy to damage. The chrome elements that look like moustaches feel very out of place; especially on this Cosmos Black paint shade.
The bumper has aero vents on the side that direct air towards the wheel wells.
Subtle creases on the bonnet add some muscle to the design.
Under the bonnet sits the motor. Note that there is an IC engine and a plug-in hybrid version of this car on sale internationally. Since the electric motor doesnt take up as much space, there is a lot of space here. BYD couldve added a frunk here with ease.
ADAS camera sits at the top of the front windshield, behind the IRVM. ADAS features include autonomous emergency braking, predictive collision warning, rear collision warning, rear cross-traffic alert, rear cross-traffic brake, adaptive cruise control, blind spot detection, lane keep assist, lane departure assist and high beam assist among others.
ORVMs get integrated LED turn-indicators and house cameras for the 360-degree view system.
You can tap your NFC key card on the driver-side ORVM to unlock the car.
Body-coloured door handles get request sensors on the front doors. Driver door gets a keyhole.
17-inch alloy wheels shod with 255/55 section rubber. Tyres are from Giti - a Singapore-based company. The eMax 7 gets ventilated disc brakes at the front and
solid disc brakes at the rear.
Such a random "SPACE" badge below the rear quarter glass.
The charging port is on the right where youd usually find the fuel filler. The eMax 7 comes with Vehicle to Load (VTOL) technology as well.
The glass roof has an area of 1.42 square meters and gets an electric sunshade. Note that there are no dual-tone colour options with the eMax 7.
The roof extends onto a spoiler which also houses the HMSL.
Very Audi-like tail-lamp design. Just like the front, these have a 5-pod design.
A thick chrome strip runs through the tail-lamps which feels unnecessary. You just get a big BYD badge in the middle instead of the fully spelt-out company name "Build Your Dreams" badge that you get on the Atto 3 (reference image). On the bottom left of the tailgate, you get a small EV badge and on the right, you get a "BYD eMax 7" badge. I think just an "eMax 7" badge wouldve looked cleaner here as there is already a BYD badge on top.
Very simple design for the rear bumper with a thin chrome strip that runs across the width.
A look at the underbody from the rear. You can see a few exposed high-voltage wires here. Be careful while washing the underbody of your car. Also, notice the multi-link rear suspension setup.
Alongside some MPVs that you will see on our roads. In terms of length, the eMax 7 matches the Innova but isnt as tall. Even the Marazzo feels taller than the eMax 7.
This is the eMax 7 in the Harbour Grey paint shade showcasing the vehicle-to-load feature.

BYD eMax 7 Interior Images
On the inside, you get an all-black dashboard with a very simple and straightforward design. There’s no standout element in the design. The overall quality of materials is good, but there are some areas where fit and finish could’ve been better.
While the A-pillar is thick, overall visibility is good.
Leather wrapped 3-spoke steering wheel has adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist-related buttons on the left spoke and MID controls on the right spoke. The steering is light and very easy to use in the city.
You don’t get auto wipers, but you get auto headlamps. The indicators have an electronic chime which some might find unusual.
Analogue dials for the power indication and speedometer. In the middle, you get a 5-inch LCD MID. There is a lot of information cramped into this tiny screen. A fully digital instrument cluster makes sense in an EV and BYD should’ve offered that here.
The MID displays a whole bunch of information like time, transmission mode, compass, outside temperature, drive mode, headlamp mode, regeneration mode, range and odometer. Other ADAS-related functions are also cramped into this small display. You can control the A/C temperature using the buttons on the steering wheel. You get a different display for adaptive cruise control where it senses the car ahead. There is also a cool function in the MID where you can time your 0-100 km/h timings.
The doorpad also has an all-black theme with brushed silver accents. The door pocket can hold a 1-litre bottle.
All 4 windows get auto up and down function with anti-pinch feature.
Brown seat upholstery doesn’t look very premium. Tan-coloured upholstery would’ve looked better IMO. The front seats are thin and the cushioning is soft. Support is very average.
The driver seat is 6-way electrically adjustable, while the passenger seat gets 4-way electrical adjustment.
The pedals are well-spaced and easy to use, but there is no dead pedal! This is a big miss.
Electric release for the tailgate is placed on the right-hand side of the driver. This is just for opening though. You cannot close the tailgate by using this button. The bonnet release latch is placed below.
Tall passengers will find the left side of the footwell very intrusive.
View from the IRVM is obstructed due to the rear headrests and the small rear windshield. This mirror is not very usable.
Manual IRVM is not something you expect in a car that costs ~30 lakh rupees.
ORVMs are well sized and the bezels are thin. The view from the rear is good and you also have a blind spot monitoring alert here.
The view of the rear is obstructed by the headrests and the thick C and D-pillars. Best to use the 360-degree view camera for reversing.
12.8-inch touchscreen has wired Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. A/C controls are integrated into the touchscreen and you don’t have physical buttons. You can control the temperature via the buttons on the steering wheel as well.
As we’ve seen in other BYD cars, the touchscreen can be rotated for a portrait orientation.
360-degree camera view is decent albeit slightly distorted. It is useful while parking in tight spots. A/C controls male it seem like the car has dual-zone climate control, but it is a single-zone unit. Even the seat ventilation options are accessed through the touchscreen. BYD should’ve provided physical buttons for this. Various ADAS-related options can be accessed through vehicle settings. There are a couple of energy management options along with settings for charging and tracking your consumption pattern.
The ‘-5°’ reading that you see here is in fact the gradient! Must say, we didn’t expect that.
Plain and simple A/C vents with the "Build Your Dreams" plate on top.
On the side, you will find the motor start/stop button.
You get two slots to keep your mobile phone. The one on the driver side has wireless charging.
Very nice and cute transmission mode selector. It is finished in gloss black and the throws are very short. Buttons for various operations are placed around the selector. On the left, you have volume control, blind spot warning, auto hold and regeneration level selector. On the right, you have the fan on / off button, defogger and drive mode selector.
Below, you get two cupholders and a phone slot.
Passenger side of the dashboard has a faux wood-like finish which looks nice.
Very average glovebox. No illumination or cooling here and the design is such that the opening is very limited.
The roof lights are all LED. You also have a sunglass holder and the glass roof shade control here.
The glass roof is massive and brings in a lot of light.
Both sunvisors get vanity mirrors and illumination. The sunvisors, however, don’t extend.
These are the captain seats in the 6-seater variant. These are very similar to the front seats and get adjustable armrests and headrests. They also get ISOFIX child seat anchors.
You can adjust the backrest angle and even move the seat forward if you want to free some space for the third-row passenger. I’m 5’10” tall and I had good headroom in the back seat. With the front seat adjusted to my driving position, I had a couple of inches of legroom. The floor is flat but high. The under-thigh support isn’t great thanks to the high floor.
Reading lamps are LEDs and you also get a coat hanger. Rear passengers get roof-mounted A/C vents.
Rear passengers can control the fan speed. The silhouette and company name etched above are a nice touch.
Below, you get USB ports (Type-A and Type-C) for charging and a slot to keep your phone.
Interesting design for the seatback pockets. You can keep your mobile phone on top and something else at the bottom.
To get into or out of the third-row, one has to move the captain seat forward.
The third-row of seats gets adjustable headrests and 3-point seatbelts.
I could manage to sit in the third-row with the middle row seat pushed all the way back. As you can see, there is no under-thigh support. I had only about an inch or two of headroom. This seat is best for kids, and that too for short journeys.
Here’s a look at the legroom with the middle-row seat pushed back and…
this is the legroom with the seat pushed all the way forward.
Cupholders for third-row occupants are located on the sides. Speakers are placed next to them.
The rear quarter glass is big enough to not make the third-row passengers feel claustrophobic. They also get grab handles and A/C vents (no air volume control though).
With the third-row seats up, the boot space is 180 litres.
With the third-row seats folded, the boot space goes up to 580 litres.
No spare tyre. A puncture repair kit has been provided under the boot floor.
A single halogen boot lamp is placed on the right. All the interior lights are white LEDs except for this boot lamp.
