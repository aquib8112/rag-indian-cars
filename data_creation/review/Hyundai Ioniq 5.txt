The Hyundai Ioniq 5 has been launched in India at a price of Rs. 44.95 lakhs.

Introduction
With EVs gaining popularity in India, Hyundai has introduced the Ioniq 5 SUV in the country - its second electric vehicle for the Indian market after the Kona. While the Kona is a competent vehicle, it has not managed to sell in as many numbers as its competitors such as the MG ZS EV. The Ioniq 5, however, takes the game to a whole new level in terms of technology and performance.
The Ioniq 5 comes with a 72.6 kWh battery pack and a claimed ARAI range of 631 km. Its powered by an electric motor that develops 214 BHP and 350 Nm that allows it to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in a claimed 7.6 seconds. These figures are way superior to the Kona and the demand for the new SUV seems to be a lot more as well. Hyundai launched the Ioniq 5 in December 2022 and claims to have received over 650 bookings already.

Hyundai Ioniq 5 Price & Brochure
Hyundai has priced the Ioniq 5 at a price of Rs 44.95 lakh (ex-showroom). This price though is applicable only for the first 500 customers. Technically, its a standalone product in its class as the BYD Atto 3, MG ZS EV, Kona EV and Tata Nexon EV Max are priced much lower. Also, cars like the Volvo XC40 Recharge and the Kia EV6 cost a lot more. If you had to describe the pricing of the Ioniq 5, it is on the higher side. You are also paying for the electric technology and being an early adopter of the same. Still, considering the technology on offer, we would not call it overpriced. Individuals can avail of income tax benefits under section 80EEB (only applicable for vehicles registered by individuals) -

Running Costs
The Ioniq 5 has a 72.6 kWh battery pack which translates to ~73 units of electricity for a full charge. The per-unit cost of electricity depends on the slab that you are in & your location, but on average, its about Rs 8 per unit. This translates to ~Rs 584 to charge to 100%. Hyundai claims a range of 631 km (ARAI) and while we were not able to do a range test, you should be able to get a realistic driving range of 450 km. You might get more range if you drive very conservatively. Thus, you can expect an approximate running cost of Rs. 1.3 per km which is an impressive number.

Exterior
Design & Styling
According to Hyundai, the name Ioniq 5 is taken from 5 attributes of the car: Impress exterior, Opulent Interior, Novel technologies, Incredible performance & safety and Quenching convenience.
The design of the Ioniq 5 is based on 'Concept 45', which was unveiled at the 2019 Frankfurt motor show. It draws inspiration from the Pony - Hyundai's first passenger vehicle and has a retro and timeless appearance. The car is built on Hyundai's EV-specific E-GMP architecture (which is used even in the Kia EV6) and despite it being called an SUV, it resembles a large hatchback. Its sleek and has very good proportions overall. In my opinion, is one of the best-looking EVs on sale.
It's only when you see the Ioniq 5 in person that you realise how big the car really is. It measures 4,635 mm in length, 1,890 mm in width, and 1,625 mm in height with a massive wheelbase of 3,000 mm!
Notable features on the outside include parametric pixel LED headlights, LED DRLs, LED from accent lighting, parametric pixel LED tail lamps, active air flap, 20-inch alloy wheels and flush-fitting door handles. There are 3 colour options: Gravity Gold Matte (our test car), Optic White, and Midnight Black Pearl.

Build Quality, Fit & Finish
The build quality of the Ioniq 5 is quite impressive with very little flex in the body panels. The panel gaps are tight and consistent and the fit & finish is pretty good too.

Wheels & Tyres
The Ioniq 5 gets 20-inch parametric pixel design alloy wheels shod with wide 255/45 section tyres. Our test car had Michelin Pilot Sport EV tyres which provided excellent grip in the corners. The recommended tyre pressure is 36 PSI all around. While this is on the higher side the ride quality is surprisingly good.

Ground Clearance
The Ioniq 5 has a laden ground clearance of 163 mm, which is good enough for most driving conditions in India.

Standard & Extended Warranty
The Ioniq 5 comes with a standard warranty of 3 years / unlimited km, which can be extended up to 5 years / 1,40,000 km. The battery has an 8-year / 1,60,000 km warranty. You also get 3 years of roadside assistance, 1 home visit within 15 days of delivery, 2 complimentary home chargers (3.3 kW & 11 kW) and service vehicle-to-vehicle charging support in 4 cities. There are iCare maintenance packages that can be purchased as well.

Safety
The Ioniq 5 is loaded with 60+ safety features including 6 airbags, TPMS, traction control system, ABS + EBD, electronic stability control and vehicle stability management, hill-start assist control, multi-collision avoidance brake, front and rear parking sensors, electric parking brake with auto hold, TPMS, virtual engine sound system and ISOFIX child seat anchors. You also get Level 2 ADAS (Advanced Driving Assistance System) with 21 features which Hyundai calls SmartSense. This includes features like forward collision warning, forward collision avoidance assists - car, pedestrian, cycle and junction turning, blind spot collision warning, blind spot collision avoidance assist, lane keeping assist, lane departure warning, driver attention warning, 360-degree camera system, adaptive cruise control, high beam assist, and more.

Interior
Cabin Design & Quality
The Ioniq 5 has a flat dashboard with a pebble grey theme and silver and piano black inserts. The 12.3-inch instrument cluster and the infotainment head unit are integrated into one large display that sticks out from the dashboard.
Soft touch materials have been used at places on the dashboard and door pads. There's also a magnetic portion on the right side of the instrument cluster. The quality of materials used is great in most areas and average in some areas like the switches for the electric adjustments of the seats. Overall, the cabin quality is very good and most owners will be impressed.

Space & Comfort
Getting in and out of the Ioniq 5 is quite comfortable. It’s not as tall as some SUVs though, so you have to duck slightly as you would in a crossover. Once inside, there’s a good amount of space. You can especially feel the width of the car on the inside. The front passengers don’t sit too close and the wide centre console gives you a good sense of space. HVAC components have been relocated to the engine bay, which has resulted in the crashpad being slimmed down and this, in turn, has increased interior space. What also adds to this sense of space are the light-coloured interiors, big windows, and vision sunroof. The cabin feels nice and airy.
Front passengers get wide "relaxation" seats that are very comfortable. They’re finished in eco-processed leather upholstery and dyed using flaxseed oil. They’re perforated and get seat ventilation (heating and cooling). The cushioning is on point and they provide ample support as well. There’s a healthy amount of side bolstering to keep you in place. Additionally, they get ottomans, sliding headrests and the armrest is also placed at a nice height. Besides, the floor is flat and the centre console can be slid back & forth. It has a travel range of 140 mm.

Driving Position & Ergonomics
Frontal visibility is excellent. Both front seats can be electrically adjusted in 8 ways. A lumbar adjustment has also been provided. Finding the perfect driving position is easy as the steering gets tilt & telescopic adjustment. The flat bottom steering wheel has a two-spoke design and is wrapped in leather. It’s nice to hold and has thumb contours as well. The horn is easily reachable with one's thumbs and not hard to press. The cabin is well laid out and all the functions are ergonomically placed.

Cabin Storage
There is a good amount of storage space for the front passengers. The door pockets can accommodate a 1-litre bottle and other small items. The glove box is large and can hold a lot more than just the owner’s manual and other documents. You also get a wide but shallow storage bin under the central armrest, two cupholders, an open storage compartment in the centre console and a wireless charging pad / phone holder. The base of the centre fascia also has a small soft-lined storage space for keeping a smartphone.
Rear passengers get seatback pockets that accommodate a 1-litre bottle and small articles. The seatbacks of the front seats have storage nets to keep magazines and there is also a place to keep a phone near the centre console. It comes with USB charging ports. The rear centre armrest houses two cupholders.

Air-Conditioning
We drove the Ioniq 5 in Goa, which was considerably hotter than Mumbai. Even during the afternoon, when the temperatures were high, the car’s dual-zone climate control system did an excellent job of cooling the cabin. There’s not much of a drop in the performance of the air conditioning while driving in Eco mode.

Features
Unique & Noteworthy Features
As we have come to expect from a Hyundai car, the Ioniq 5 is loaded with features. There are a few unique features like the Vehicle-to-Load mobile power supply function, which transforms the car into a power bank. It supports power up to 3.3 kW, which is good enough for most high-power electrical appliances. Additionally, there’s ambient lighting a vision roof, a hands-free tailgate, adaptive headlamps, smartphone connectivity, wireless charger, relaxation front seats, ventilated front and rear seats, memory function for all seats, auto headlamps and wipers, connected car technology and an 8-speaker Bose sound system with a subwoofer. On the other hand, a rear wiper, spare wheel a sunroof with glass that slides and wireless Android Auto & Apple CarPlay have not been provided.

Audio System & Sound Quality
The 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment head-unit has a crisp display. There’s no lag and jumping through different options and screens is pretty seamless. The interface is very user-friendly and finding the right function is easy. It’s paired with an 8-speaker Bose sound system that includes a sub-woofer.

Rear Passengers
Rear Seat Comfort & Space
Just like the front seats, getting in and out of the rear seats is easy. You get 3 adjustable headrests and 3-point seatbelts for all 3 passengers. Due to the sheer width of the cabin and the flat floor an adult third passenger in the middle won’t be very uncomfortable. The hard backrest (due to the centre armrest) isn’t something one would look forward to experiencing, but for short journeys, seating 3 in the back shouldn’t be a problem.
There’s a good amount of knee room and headroom for rear passengers and to help matters, both the rear seats can get fore & aft adjustment. Even tall occupants will have enough legroom, but one can't slide his feet under the front seats as there is just no space. The backrests also get a healthy reclining range. The cushioning is spot on and should be comfortable over long drives. However, the high floor results in a knees-up seating position which can get irritating. Rear passengers get a centre armrest with two cupholders, seatback pockets air-con vents mounted on the B-pillars, and USB charging ports.

Boot Space
The Ioniq 5 has a very healthy boot space of 527 litres with the rear seats up. The 60:40 split rear seats can be folded down to increase cargo space to a massive 1,587 litres. As mentioned earlier, the Ioniq 5 doesn’t get a spare wheel. Instead, you get a tyre puncture repair kit. We’d suggest you invest in one as it is always better to have a spare wheel in case of a tyre blowout.
Additionally, the frunk can hold 57 litres of luggage.

Driving the Ioniq 5
Bonnet has liquids and electricals on either side of the frunk.
It's important to note that the Ioniq 5 is built on an EV-specific platform and is not based on an IC engine platform like many other EVs. Hence, the design of the batteries and powertrain has been done keeping the EV-specific requirements in mind. The 72.6 kWh battery pack is compact and consists of high-density battery cells mounted on the floor of the car between the front and rear axles.
The Ioniq 5 is powered by a rear-mounted Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor with a silicon carbide-based inverter. It also gets a cooling feature in which an electric oil pump sprays a mist of cooling/lubricating oil onto the coil inside the motor.
Start the car, shift to ‘D’ mode, take your foot off the brake pedal and the car gets off the line in a smooth manner. It will crawl forward at 6 km/h without any accelerator input. The power delivery till part throttle is linear and predictable. There are no jerks from gearshifts and no sound from the engine sound means it is an extremely refined experience. We preferred to use the Eco mode while driving in the city. It felt more than adequate for driving in the city and keeping up with the traffic. Also with the regen set to its strongest level, the Ioniq 5 can be driven by just using the accelerator and without using the brakes in bumper-to-bumper traffic. All these factors make the Ioniq 5 easy to use in the city traffic. However, one has to keep in mind the size of the car. It is long and wide and so, you need to be careful when driving through narrow lanes. Thankfully, the all-around visibility is decent and a 360-degree camera system has been provided.
On the open road, the Ioniq 5 provides instant acceleration when you touch the accelerator. The instant acceleration will see you leaving most ICE cars behind, left in the dust. Hyundai claims that the Ioniq 5 will do a 0-100 km/h sprint in 7.6 seconds. If you enjoy instant acceleration and are experiencing an electric car for the first time, this car might just make you a convert. If you’ve driven some of the other EVs, you will notice that the acceleration is very similar to others in this range.
The Ioniq 5 can easily cruise at triple-digit speeds on the highway and when you need to overtake a slower vehicle quickly, just floor the A-pedal and fly past the vehicle. However, the harder you drive, the faster the range drops. This is also why you will see EVs that are driving longer distances sticking to the middle lane and cruising at 80-100 km/h (which is the best cruising speed for the current lots of EVs).
There are 4 driving modes to choose from and unlike some other cars, these aren't gimmicky. They're mapped specifically for different driving styles and also change the steering weight.
Normal Mode: This is the default mode to drive in and works well in the city as well as the highway. It is a good balance of power and economy.
Eco Mode: When you want to extract maximum range, this is the mode to engage. The throttle response is dumbed down which results in a smoother drive. However, you never feel that the car is lacking power. There’s still enough power on tap to keep up with traffic and even overtake quickly. We found this mode to be the best for driving in the city.
Sport Mode: Want to show your friends the EV acceleration, scroll down to this mode and off you go. The throttle response is sharp and the car feels ready to fly. It feels a little too jerky for day-to-day city driving and also eats up battery faster. The difference between Normal and Sport modes is greater than that between Normal and Eco modes.
Snow - This mode is hidden. One needs to press and hold the mode button to activate it. It is useful for tricky, slippery conditions that you find in cold countries during the winter.

Regenerative Braking
The Ioniq 5 comes with 4 levels of regenerative braking. The first level is barely noticeable and if you have the car in this mode, you might end up using the brakes a lot. On levels 2 & 3, the braking gets progressively stronger. On level 4, it is very strong and if you lift off the accelerator, the car will ultimately come to a halt. Engine-braking lovers will appreciate driving with regen at the maximum level. You can also turn off the regenerative brake if you want.

Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH)
As is the case with EVs, the Ioniq 5 is also super quiet. There’s no engine or gearbox to make any noise, so the overall driving experience is silent. At low speeds, the car’s pedestrian warning system music (or virtual engine sound system as Hyundai calls it) is heard on the outside. It's not as loud as the BYD Atto 3's warning and cannot be heard inside the cabin.
Cabin insulation is top class and wind noise and tyre / road noise is well controlled. Overall, the cabin of the Ioniq is a quiet and comfortable place to be in.

Range
The Hyundai Ioniq 5 has an ARAI-claimed range of 631 km. In real-world driving conditions, you can expect a range of ~ 450 km. Given the rising demand for EVs, there are plenty of charging stations popping up everywhere, which ought to take care of range anxiety as well. There are many apps and websites like
pulseenergy.io,plugshare.com, etc. that list out all the charging stations near you. At the end of the day though, remember the golden rule = EVs are best charged where they are parked (either at your office or home).

Charging
Hyundai provides 2 complimentary home chargers: 3.3kW and 11 kW. If you’re travelling and need a quick refill, a 350 kW DC fast charger can juice up the battery from 10% to 80% in just 18 minutes. 400V and 800V chargers can also be used to charge the car.

Suspension & Ride Comfort
The Ioniq 5 gets a MacPherson strut suspension at the front and a multi-link suspension at the rear. The car’s suspension is set up to be compliant for day-to-day usage, it is not impractically stiff. Low-speed ride is good and the car absorbs small to medium-sized bumps quite well. The roads in Goa are good for the most part we couldn't find Mumbai-like craters to go through. The recommended tyre pressure is a rather high 36 psi. But even with this pressure and 20-inch alloy wheels, the ride is very absorbent. Dropping the pressure to 32 psi might help improve the ride further.

Handling & Dynamics
In a straight line, the Ioniq 5 feels stable, at least till 100 km/h. In the corners, the body roll is well-controlled. The low centre of gravity helps matters here. At the moderate speeds that we managed to drive at, the car felt stable while tackling corners with the 255 mm tyres providing great grip. That said, a better picture of the driving dynamics can be presented only after driving on roads with undulations and mid-corner bumps.

Steering
The electric power steering is a nice unit and easy to operate as well. It is light at city speeds which makes it very user-friendly. The steering weighs up well on the highways. Overall, it feels connected and inspires confidence.

Braking
The Ioniq 5 has discs at the front and rear. All in all, the car has good stopping power. In our short test drive, the car stopped without any drama when the brakes were slammed.
