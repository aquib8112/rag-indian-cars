The Force Gurkha always carried the silhouette of the Mercedes Benz G Wagon, and now, it's even more so!
While the previous Gurkha looked like more of an evolved Trax / Traveller, the new 2021 model seems to have gained character. Further, it gets LED headlamps with DRLs, foglamps, 17-inch alloy wheels, a hardtop design and a snorkel to remind you this car means serious offroading.
The Gurkha has always been a bit player with marginal monthly sales, yet it does have a fan following.
Built on an updated chassis, the 3-door version of the Gurkha has a wheelbase of 2,400 mm. The wheelbase extends to 2,825 mm for the 5-door version. It measures 4,116 mm in length, 1,812 mm in width and 2,075 mm in height.
The Gurkha feels sturdy, but there are areas of concern. Panel gaps are uneven at places and the doors dont have the heft of a Korean or European car. The bonnet, on the other hand, is super heavy and has plenty of insulation for dialling down the engine noise.
You get remote locking & unlocking with the key (no smartkey). If you want to find your Gurkha in a parking lot at night, there is a find-my-car feature via a button on the key. This switches on the hazard lights, but without any audio alert.
The doors have leather straps to hold them from swinging out!! No stages in the opening action. It's as simple as simple can be.
The Gurkha is a tall vehicle, so ingress and egress are a challenge. You will have to use the side step to get into the front seats. You also get grab handles on the A pillars to help you climb inside. Rear passengers will have to use the tailgate door and climb inside the car to sit on the two rear seats!! Of course, rear passengers have it easier in the 5-door variant.
Gone is the old utilitarian dashboard and in its place is a new all-black dash with a 7-inch touchscreen that gets Android Auto & Apple CarPlay. Despite the black dashboard, the cabin feels airy due to the massive glass area. The tall windshield & windows bring in a lot of light in the front.
The quality of interiors is poor. This will be a deal-breaker for many. The plastics used are very basic, while the fit & finish aren't great either. The glovebox in our test vehicle kept falling open, randomly over rough roads! The seats are good though.
Force claims that the Gurkha has 44% more window area than the competition, and we don't doubt that. All-round visibility is excellent.
ORVMs are tall and provide a good view of action at the rear. IRVM is tiny in comparison and its rear view is restricted by the captain seats. Rearward visibility is satisfactory as theres no middle passenger (captain seats in the second row).
The driver's seat is placed high to give you a great view of the road ahead. Seats have a good amount of side bolstering and provide ample support. While driving on bad roads and in off-roading, the seats keep you in place. Youre not left sliding all over the place.
Ergonomically, most things fall in hand quite easily. You have a couple of cubbyholes in the centre console, along with cupholders and a phone holder as well. But the glovebox is small.
No dead pedal has been provided. Moreover, theres not much space beyond the clutch pedal to rest your foot. So, you will have to rest your foot below the clutch pedal while driving. This will take getting used to. Those who've driven other body-on-frame Mahindras & Tatas might find the transition easier than say, someone moving from a Dzire or i20 who will be shocked with the cabin!
Big steering wheel is basic and good to hold. The hornpad is easy to reach and the steering also offers tilt + telescopic adjustments. With the new Gurkha, you get a rack & pinion steering replacing the old recirculating ball mechanism. The new steering column is also collapsible, which reduces the odds of occupant injury in a crash. Speaking of safety, the Gurkha gets only 2 airbags like the Thar.
Power window buttons are placed on the centre console.
Doorpad gets a leatherette insert which is soft to touch. Near the armrest area, you have a nice fabric area too, alongside the hard plastics. The door pockets are tiny and are only capable of holding a phone + misc stuff. No bottles will fit here.
Aircon worked great in our short drive. You get minimum and maximum AC settings too.
The touchscreen infotainment unit is an aftermarket unit from Kenwood that has been tuned for the Gurkha. It has smartphone connectivity, but isnt very user friendly. The buttons are small and the orientation takes some time to get used to.
Sound quality from the 4-speaker unit is basic.
Front-facing rear captain seats are the same as the front seats, so you can adjust the recline angle! Passengers will enjoy the support. Both seats get ISOFIX child seat anchors and offer adjustable headrests.
The view from the rear seats is great! It almost feels like you're sitting in a safari vehicle. Take your family to the jungle and they'll love you back for life!
Since there are no folding rear seats, the boot space is constant at 500 litres. This kind of boot space is a key advantage over the Thar.
All passengers get USB charging ports for their devices.

2.6 litre BS6 compliant engine is derived from the Mercedes OM611 engine. This is a 4 cylinder diesel making 90 BHP @ 3,200 rpm and 250 Nm @ 1,400 - 2,400 rpm. It’s mated to a 5-speed (G28/5) manual transmission. Sadly, that
Gurkha Extreme's 140 horsepower 2.2L engine
hasn't been made BS6 compliant. The power ratings are enough to tell you this motor is all about the low end (and offroading), while not offering any top-end.
With the clutch pedal pressed, twist the key and the diesel motor comes to life with a shudder. There’s cabin shake and despite the improved NVH levels (as compared to the BS4 Gurkha), you can still hear the engine in the cabin... it reminded Moderator Aditya of the old Tata Sumo. You can also feel vibrations on the steering wheel and pedals.
The clutch pedal has a long travel range, but isn’t too heavy. Lift off the clutch and the Gurkha crawls forward nicely, thanks to the ample low-end torque.
Like most off-roaders, the initial lot of gears are short and you will be shifting up quickly while driving on normal roads.
The turbo kicks in early at ~1,300 rpm, with the engine pulling nicely till ~2,800 rpm. The max that the engine revs to is just 3,400 rpm!
Since the powerband is narrow, you will find yourself moving through the gears a lot.
The Gurkha isn’t a fast car by any means. Reaching 80 or 100 kmph takes time. Cruising at 80 kph in 5th gear, you will find the motor spinning at ~1,800 rpm.  100 kph comes at ~2,500 rpm in 5th.
At the front, the Gurkha has an independent double wishbone suspension with coil springs and at the rear is a multi-link suspension with a Panhard rod. There is an anti-roll bar at the front as well as rear.
Our test car was equipped with 245/70 R16 all-terrain tyres which provided decent grip when driving off-road, but made noise even at 60 kmph while driving on road.
Low speed ride quality is good for a ladder-on-frame offroader. The independent suspension really comes into its own when handling small to medium-sized potholes and bumps. There is of course some side to side movement in the cabin, yet in comparison with some of the other offroaders (Thar & Gypsy), the Gurkha was impressive.
High-speed stability is okay. Since the maximum speed which we could achieve on these tiny village roads outside Pune was 100 kmph, the Gurkha didn’t feel nervous at any point.
Turn into a fast curve and the height of the vehicle means body roll is evident. It’s controlled to an extent, but you will do well to remember this vehicle's expertise is in offroading, not hard corners.
Carry excess speed into a corner and you can feel the rear step out a little, which in this car isn’t a good feeling at all. Again, understand the nature of the vehicle and drive it wisely.
The steering is not very light at parking speeds and does require some effort. It weighs up nicely when you gain speed.
The Gurkha has a turning radius of 5.65 metres which is slightly smaller than the Thar. 3-point turns in this big vehicle didn’t seem as cumbersome as you would imagine.
The brakes are spongy and the bite point is further away than you would expect. I wish the feel was more progressive. Standard disc brakes at the front with drum brakes at the rear.
The Gurkha has a live independent front axle and live rigid rear axle. The transfer case is developed in-house and has been tried & tested by the Force Motors team at Rainforest Challenge events in the past.
Has a water wading capacity of 700 mm and a gradeability of 35 degrees in 4x4 mode.
We did get a chance to take the vehicle on some off-road trails and the Gurkha impressed us throughout in 4x4 mode.
Our offroad trails included going around in freshly created (God bless the rains) massive slush pits on the borders of farms. The Gurkha cleared everything with ease. This is where Force's 4x4 feels most at home. What's equally sweet is the ride quality & supportive seats while offroading - far better than oldschool Jeeps which throw you all around the cabin.
A trick up the Gurkha’s sleeve is the mechanically-locking front and rear differentials. While driving, I got stuck in slush, facing 90-degrees the wrong way. All I had to do was pull the rear differential lever and twist it to lock the rear diff. After that, it was just a matter of releasing the clutch and the Gurkha moved out of the tight spot as if being lifted off by a magic carpet.
Safety features include dual airbags, follow-me-home headlamps & lead me to car function, rear parking sensors, speed sensing auto door lock, tyre pressure monitoring system and ABS with EBD. Force claims that the vehicle structure meets the regulations by an excellent margin since the structure optimisation has been done with the IDIADA team from Spain. Nope, it's not been GNCAP tested like the Thar (4 stars) and doesn't have all that safety kit either (e.g. ESP).
