{"inputs": "What is Skoda's Dynamic Chassis Control (DCC) in the 2022 Kodiaq?", "outputs": "Skoda's Dynamic Chassis Control (DCC) is a system that alters the suspension tune by adjusting damper settings through adaptive dampers. These dampers use electromagnetic valves to control oil flow based on driving conditions and selected driving mode, allowing the suspension to switch between softer and stiffer setups.", "source": "reviews"}
{"inputs": "How does the DCC system affect ride comfort in the Skoda Kodiaq?", "outputs": "The DCC system in the Kodiaq provides greater flexibility in ride comfort. In Comfort mode, the suspension becomes soft and cushy, effectively absorbing potholes and broken roads, making it ideal for city driving. In Sport mode, the suspension firms up noticeably, providing a more connected and responsive feel.", "source": "reviews"}
{"inputs": "Which drive modes are available in the Skoda Kodiaq's DCC system and how do they differ?", "outputs": "The Kodiaq's DCC system offers Comfort and Sport modes. Comfort mode offers a soft, cushy ride ideal for city use and bad roads, while Sport mode firms up the suspension, enhancing handling and road feel. The difference between the two modes is significant, especially on uneven roads.", "source": "reviews"}
{"inputs": "How effective is the Kodiaq's suspension in Comfort mode?", "outputs": "In Comfort mode, the Kodiaq's suspension is soft and effectively absorbs potholes and rough surfaces. It provides a silent and smooth ride, with only large potholes making a noticeable impact in the cabin.", "source": "reviews"}
{"inputs": "Is Sport mode in the Kodiaq suitable for bad city roads?", "outputs": "Sport mode significantly stiffens the suspension, making the ride noticeably harsher on imperfect city roads. On such surfaces, the suspension comfort rating drops from a 9/10 in Comfort mode to a 6/10 in Sport mode.", "source": "reviews"}
{"inputs": "How does the Kodiaq's ride quality compare to its sibling, the Tiguan?", "outputs": "In Comfort mode, the Kodiaq\u2019s ride quality is superior to that of the Tiguan, even though both ride on the same 18\" rims and tyre size. The adaptive suspension in the Kodiaq makes a noticeable difference in ride comfort.", "source": "reviews"}
{"inputs": "What is the recommended tyre pressure for the 2022 Skoda Kodiaq?", "outputs": "The recommended tyre pressure for the 2022 Skoda Kodiaq is 35 PSI all around, which is 1 PSI less than the Volkswagen Tiguan.", "source": "reviews"}
