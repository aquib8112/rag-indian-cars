4-star GNCAP safety rating is praiseworthy

Tata Tigor iCNG AMT Cons
Reduced power output is evident on the highway. CNG mode has lesser top-end performance
Many Indian cities & towns don’t have CNG pumps. The queue for CNG cars can be long in metro cities
Higher maintenance costs & upkeep (overall) in comparison with the regular petrol variant
When driven hard, the AMT can't match the smoothness & shift-times of a conventional automatic. Gets confused on climbs as well
AMT is not available in the XM variant
Dead pedal is not suitable for people with large feet
Focus on CNG driveability means that the FE numbers will take a bit of a hit
Firmer suspension & higher tyre psi rating means you feel more of the bad roads / potholes
A rare Tata car that cannot seat 5 (best for 4 adults)
All passengers need to get out of the vehicle while refilling CNG
Some missing features (full-size spare wheel, alloy wheels...)
Tata's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble

Introduction
When we reviewed the
Tata Tiago iCNG in 2022, the car was available with a manual transmission only. The same was the case with its sedan sibling, the Tigor iCNG. In a market where automatic transmissions are gaining popularity rapidly, selling a car with a manual gearbox only restricts its appeal.
To address this problem, Tata Motors has introduced an AMT version of the Tigor iCNG. This means that the car now offers the convenience of an automatic coupled with lower running costs of CNG. It is also the first CNG car in India with an "automatic" transmission.
The Tigor iCNG comes with a sequential CNG kit that features Tata's twin-cylinder setup for better space utilisation. This makes a big difference as it allows you to use some boot space that otherwise wouldn’t be possible. Powering the Tigor iCNG is the same 1.2-litre, 3-cylinder Revotron petrol engine as the Tiago iCNG. It makes 72 BHP and 95 Nm in CNG mode (vs 85 BHP and 113 Nm in petrol mode). The engine is mated to a 5-speed AMT. The Tigor iCNG also gets a retuned suspension setup to account for the added weight due to the tank at the rear and overall, it comes with all the pros and cons that are associated with a sequential CNG kit, all of which we will be discussing later in the review.

Tata Tigor iCNG AMT Price & Brochure
The Tigor iCNG AMT is being offered in 2 variants – XZA and XZA+. While the XZA is priced at Rs. 8,84,900 (ex-showroom), the XZA+ costs Rs. 9,54,900 (ex-showroom). If you do a variant-to-variant price comparison with the MT version, the AMT variants are approximately Rs. 60,000 more expensive. We would have liked to see the AMT make it to middle variants too.

Ground Clearance
To bear the additional weight of the CNG tanks at the rear, Tata has retuned the suspension of the Tigor. The Tigor CNG’s unladen ground clearance is rated at 165 mm which is 5 mm less than the petrol variant.

Standard & Extended Warranty
The Tigor iCNG AMT is being offered with a 3-year or 1,00,000 km warranty. Extended warranty for the fourth and fifth year can be purchased. As always, we recommend you opt for the maximum extended warranty for additional peace of mind.

Safety
The Tigor is known for its 4-star GNCAP safety rating. The top variant is equipped with safety features such as dual airbags, ISOFIX, ABS + EBD, Cornering Stability Control, reverse parking sensors, ISOFIX child seat anchors, 3-point seatbelts (all seats), seatbelt reminders (all seats), reversing camera, automatic headlamps & wipers and TPMS.
Apart from these, there are a few CNG-specific safety features like the use of high-quality stainless steel tubes and fittings to prevent any leaks. They’re also rust and corrosion-resistant and have been tested across temperatures and pressures. In the case of an accident, the CNG fuel is automatically cut off and the remaining gas from the tubes is released directly into the atmosphere through a special nozzle. The car also switches to petrol automatically if a leak is detected in the system.
The twin CNG cylinders are placed below the luggage area in the boot as the valve and pipes are protected under the boot floor. This reduces the risk of damage.
The Tigor CNG is fitted with a micro switch inside the fuel lid. This is an additional safety feature that turns off the engine as soon as the fuel lid is opened. The switch will also not allow the engine to be cranked until the lid is closed. There’s also a fire extinguisher placed under the driver's seat.

Tata Tigor iCNG AMT Exterior Review
The Tigor iCNG AMT is based on the facelifted version of the car that was introduced in 2018.
Front end features new headlamps, radiator grille, bumper, LED DRLs and restyled fog lamps.

A look at the restyled rear bumper. Parking sensors are placed higher up and the black portion has been reworked. It gets a chrome strip running across.
Spare wheel is mounted underneath the car. It is a 15-inch steel wheel shod with T135/80 section space saver.

Tata Tigor iCNG AMT Interior Review
Dashboard is identical in design to the Tiago. XZ and XZ+ variants get a light black & beige dual-tone interior theme.
Side A/C vents get bronze housings with chrome inserts.
Leather-wrapped, flat-bottom steering wheel is soft and good to hold.
Steering gets a prominent bronze insert.
Buttons for the audio system, telephony and voice commands are placed on the left spoke. A useful mute function has been provided (long press to mute). Notice the small horn symbol (next to steering buttons on both sides) - extended horn-pad!
Fully digital instrument cluster gets a tachometer on the left, and a petrol fuel gauge on the right. In the top right corner is the CNG tank gauge. This is a neat integration and looks cool too. However, no engine temperature gauge has been provided, which IMO, is extremely important, especially in a CNG car.
MID shows a TPMS, digital speedometer, odometer, 2 trip meters and outside temperature. While running in petrol mode, it shows the distance to empty and average fuel consumption as well.
Instrument cluster has indicator lamps for CNG mode and DRLs. MID also notifies you when you activate or deactivate CNG mode. It also points out exactly which door (or boot) is open. If the fuel lid is not closed, it will warn you and the engine will not crank.
Selected gear is displayed in the MID.
Wiper and light stalks are shared with other Tata cars. XZ+ variant gets automatic headlamps and rain-sensing wipers.
Engine start/stop button gets a thick chrome ring around it.
Doorpads are largely similar to the original Tigor. However, the design of the grab handle has been changed.
The design of the door handles and locks has been changed as well.
AMT instructions have been pasted on the top of the doorpad.
Sticker on the door sill tells you where to find the fire extinguisher.
Another sticker tells you to run the car in petrol mode for at least 10 km for every 300 km covered in CNG.
A third sticker indicates the air pressure to be maintained in the tyres.
Front seats are identical in design to the pre-facelift car. The leather upholstery, however, is new.
A closer look at the Benecke-Kaliko leatherette upholstery. The light colour means it will be more prone to getting soiled.
No contrast stitching here.
Footwell is large and spacious with the A & B pedals well spaced out. The dead pedal is narrow though and not very comfortable for people with larger feet.
Centre fascia has a clean design and features a 7-inch touchscreen head-unit, a few buttons below it and the automatic climate control switches further down.
The 7-inch Harman touchscreen head-unit is basic, yet packs all the features that you would need from a touchscreen. The home screen gets a split display and the touchscreen is pretty convenient to use, with very little lag. Music is played through 4 speakers and 4 tweeters. Sound quality is good by budget sedan standards. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity has been provided as well.
Touchscreen doubles up as a display for the reversing camera, which has adaptive guidelines.
The CNG button gets a green light to indicate that the CNG mode has been activated. A feature of the Tigor iCNG is that the car can start in CNG mode.
Climate control console is located below.
You now get a 5V, 3A Type-C USB charging port. Cover for the 12V power outlet does not have a chrome ring around it.
AMT gear shifter has a chrome insert and a glossy black console.
Move it to the left to engage 'manual' mode.
Centre console is identical in design to the pre-facelift car. However, the cover for the 12V power outlet does not have a chrome ring around it.
An ABC-type fire extinguisher is placed in the front passenger side footwell.
Basic CNG-related safety instructions are pasted on the windshield.
Key fob is identical to the one seen in other Tata cars.
Rear doorpad remains identical in design to the pre-facelift. The only change here is the new door handle and lock.
Rear bench is identical in design to the pre-facelift car.
The rear centre armrest is soft & comfortable to use. It houses two cupholders.
3-point seatbelts have been provided for all three rear seat occupants. All variants come with ISOFIX child seat anchors.
Both front seats get dual seatback pockets for the rear passengers to store items.
Boot space in the CNG variant is significantly less than the 419-litre unit of the Tigor petrol. However, you still get a lot more usable space than other CNG cars.
Underneath the boot floor, you have a twin-cylinder setup. The total water capacity of these tanks is 70 litres. Tata has gone for this setup to get some usable boot space and also to conceal the valve and pipes under the boot floor in the interests of safety.
Bright yellow sticker warns one not to keep luggage on top of the valve access flap.
Manual shut-off valve that cuts off the CNG flow to the engine.
Valve for the second cylinder is located further inside.
Next to the tanks, you have a nut that needs to be turned to lower the spare wheel. The spare wheel is a 15-inch steel rim shod with T135/70 section space saver.

Driving the Tata Tigor 1.2L CNG AMT
1.2-litre, 3-cylinder engine puts out 72 BHP @ 6,000 rpm & 95 Nm @ 3,500 rpm in CNG mode. That's 13 BHP & 18 Nm lower than in petrol mode. Summary = It is driveable and friendly in the city, but just average on the highway.
Powering the Tigor iCNG AMT is the same 1.2L, 3-cylinder engine as the Tigor petrol. In CNG mode, it produces 72 BHP and 95 Nm. Since 2022, the car has been available with a 5-speed manual gearbox only. Now, Tata Motors has given buyers the option of a 5-speed AMT as well. The company claims that this is India's first automatic CNG sedan.
Before we get to the driving part, heres a glance at what happens in a sequential CNG kit. CNG is stored at high pressure in tanks (around 200 bar) that are placed in the boot. When the gas is to be introduced into the engine, it doesnt have to be at such high pressure. Hence, it is sent through high-pressure lines towards a pressure regulator/reducer. This reducer brings down the pressure to usable levels and then directs the gas towards the engine through a low-pressure filter that removes the impurities and moisture.
If youve driven a CNG car before, you might be aware of the fact that its always recommended (especially on cold start) to start the car in petrol mode and switch to CNG mode after some time. That gives the engine some time to get proper lubrication and reach the proper temperature. However, in the Tata Tigor iCNG, things are a little different. The car starts in CNG mode if you have switched it off in CNG mode! Tata says that the injectors have been calibrated to ensure that theres proper lubrication and no harm is caused to the engine over the long term. It will start in petrol mode automatically if the CNG levels are low.
The AMT has the standard N, R, A and M positions. There is no 'P' (park) mode like in a conventional AT. With the gear shifter in the "N" position, press the brake and hit the engine start/stop button to crank the engine. The engine will not crank if any of the other gears is engaged. Engage "A", lift off the brake and the car starts crawling forward without any throttle input at 7 km/h. This is a very useful feature in bumper-to-bumper traffic as the car can be driven with just one pedal - the brake.
Throttle response is acceptable and drivability is good. In general, cruising along with urban traffic is easy. With a light foot, the transmission shifts up at ~2,000 rpm. This ensures that the engine is always in its power band and you can always keep up with the traffic. The gearbox is responsive to throttle inputs as well and readily shifts down when you want to close a gap to the car in front. The good driveability, light controls and all-round visibility along with the compact size, make the Tigor very easy to drive and park in the city. Sure, there is a power deficit vs petrol, yet the Tigor's CNG mode is extremely useable & driveable in the city.
You can switch between petrol and CNG modes by pressing the sweetly integrated CNG button below the touchscreen. While shifting from petrol to CNG, the system makes a "clunk" sound, but it is muted and not as loud as some rivals and there is no jerk felt. Also, the car will automatically switch to petrol mode in case of low CNG levels. You will notice that the throttle response is a little dull in CNG mode, yet still acceptable. Another thing you will notice while driving in CNG mode is the air-con still manages to cool the cabin effectively. The engine's performance is further dulled though.
As long as one is not very aggressive with the throttle, the AMT's shifts are acceptable. It's only when the driver gets aggressive with the throttle that things get jerkier, resulting in your head swaying back & forth. To sum it up, if you've experienced a torque-converter or dual-clutch automatic before, you're not likely to be impressed. On the other hand, if you are new to the world of automatics or have used other entry-level AMTs, acceptability will be easier.
While every upshift in the lower gears is felt, the shifting in higher gears is smoother. You could even try this old trick with AMTs = when accelerating up to speed, let off the accelerator at intervals. The AMT will seize that opportunity to upshift, making things smoother.
On the open road, the AMT is much more at ease with a relaxed driving style than an aggressive one. It works well for a driver who prefers to build up speed gradually. With a light foot, the transmission is also smoother. Driving in 'A' mode is good on the highway as long as you are happy to cruise.
Put your foot hard down and the engine revs to 6,000 rpm before the transmission shifts up - that's where the redline starts. What is noticeable is that when the driver floors the throttle, the downshifting is not close to being as quick as a conventional AT. I would recommend using manual mode for overtaking at speed or on narrower highways.
On a climb, there are times when the transmission gets confused and shifts up when you dont want it to. If you stop on an incline, yes, rollback is very much there. Use the handbrake for the sake of safety & your clutch.
The car comes equipped with a 'manual mode' that can be engaged by moving the gear shifter to A, and then to the left. Push the shifter up to upshift and pull it down to downshift (just the way we like it). M mode comes in handy when one wants to overtake quickly. While the response time is far from instant, it's not annoyingly long either. M mode is useful to bring the engine into its powerband before an overtaking manoeuvre & also during the actual overtaking (to prevent the AMT from an unintentional or slow upshift while you're overtaking). Of course, even in M mode, the transmission upshifts if the engine revs to 5,500 rpm & it will downshift on its own if the revs drop below too low. The transmission will not allow you to upshift if it finds the revs too low or downshift if it finds the resultant revs to be too high.
The manual mode allows engine braking, down to 2nd and even 1st gear. Driving downhill, M mode aids engine braking which in turn, reduces the workload on the braking hardware. There is a small gap between the time you tap the gear lever and the gearshift actually happening.

Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH)
This is a 3-cylinder engine and thats pretty evident when you start the car. Theres a mild cabin shake and you can feel the vibrations seeping in through the pedals and seat. Even on the move, you will always be aware that its a 3-cylinder engine.
While engine NVH is still tolerable in the city and youll get used to it, on the highway, it starts getting loud + coarse at high revs, especially above 4,500 rpm.
Wind noise starts creeping in at 100 km/h and road and tyre noise are on the higher side. Even at 80-90 km/h, road and tyre noise are audible.

Mileage & Fuel Economy
The CNG tank's capacity is 70 litres (water capacity), which is approximately 12 kg of CNG (at 200 bar max pressure and very low temperatures). In Mumbai, the price of CNG is Rs. 76 / kg (as of 20/02/2024). So, for a full tank, you would be paying ~Rs. 912. The claimed fuel efficiency figure is 28.06 km/kg. This means you get a range of approximately 336 km on a full tank of CNG. Hence, the cost per km of running the Tigor iCNG is about
Rs. 2.7 / km.
Now, this is very theoretical and practically, things are a little different. The CNG tanks capacity to hold gas depends heavily on the tank pressure. This drops down with usage and drops rapidly if you run the tank on low for too long. Also, most CNG pumps have a long queue, which doesnt really keep the gas cool, further reducing the amount of gas that gets put into the tank. So, dont be surprised if your tank gets full at 10 kg. Thats pretty normal.
The important thing to remember is that CNG fuel economy heavily depends on your driving style. Some owners have achieved the claimed economy figures (or very close numbers) of their CNG cars with sedate driving.
The Tigor iCNG is equipped with an NGV1 receptacle nozzle that allows for faster and safer refuelling. Notice the switch at the top? Thats the micro switch which switches off the ignition as soon as the fuel lid is opened. The switch will also not allow the engine to start until the lid is closed.
The back of the fuel lid has the CNG certification plate. The Tata badging on the plate indicates that the CNG kit has been factory-fitted.

Suspension & Ride Comfort
The Tigor iCNG gets a MacPherson strut suspension at the front and a twist-beam dual-path strut suspension at the rear. It rides on 14-inch rims shod with 175/65 section tyres. The recommended tyre pressure rating is 33 PSI at the front and 36 PSI at the rear. This makes sense as the CNG tanks have been placed in the boot, adding weight at the back. One of the advantages of getting a factory-fitted CNG kit is you dont have to worry about suspension tuning or adding coil spring spacers at the back. The manufacturers R&D team takes care of everything. The Tigors suspension has been stiffened up to take the added kerb weight.
While driving with the recommended tyre pressure rating, you will notice that the suspension has been made firmer. Yet ride quality is still compliant enough on regular roads. On the other hand, you will feel broken roads more and sharp bumps do come in stronger. If you usually drive alone or with the occasional one / two passengers, dropping the tyre pressure to 33 PSI for all tyres will improve the ride.

Handling & Dynamics
The Tigor's straight-line stability is very good for the segment and the dynamics are overall safe & conservative...just the kind of neutral behaviour you'd expect of a budget sedan. Nothing to write home about, nothing to complain about either. Youll be cruising at 100 km/h without feeling nervous or unsettled.
Body roll is controlled as compared to other cars in the segment and it aids the handling characteristics of the car too. Get on some twisty roads and youll appreciate the suspension setup even more. The car feels agile and you can carry good speed into corners. The Tigor holds on to its line and doesn't understeer easily. The car's solid build further boosts your confidence. Changing direction on back-to-back corners is no problem either. The compact dimensions of the car and the suspension tuning don't really make you feel like you are carrying extra weight at the rear.
The 175/65 section Apollo Amazer tyres are fine for regular driving, but struggle when the car is pushed hard in corners.

Steering
The electric power-assisted steering is a nice unit. It is light at parking speeds and weighs up adequately as you gain speed. Additionally, it isn't lifeless and does give you some feedback on what the front wheels are up to.

Braking
The Tigor iCNG gets disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear. It is also equipped with ABS+EBD and cornering stability control (CSC). Tata says "CSC supports / stabilizes the vehicle during partial braking in curves by reducing pressure at the required inner wheel. This helps to reduce the probability of vehicle oversteer during cornering + braking". The braking performance, in general, is satisfactory. However, we feel that wider tyres would definitely improve the braking of the car. The brakes feel progressive and the car reacts in a very predictable manner while braking.
