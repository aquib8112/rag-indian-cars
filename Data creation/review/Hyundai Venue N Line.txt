Hyundai Venue N Line Cons
More of a warmed-up compact crossover than a proper hot crossover
1.0L DCT variant shows initial lag. Even otherwise, it’s not as explosive as VW’s 1.0 TSI
Handling is not as confidence-inspiring as one would expect from a "hot" crossover. Tyre upgrade is mandatory! The OEM rubber gives up easily
Diminutive street presence. Looks more hatchback than SUV from some angles, especially the rear
Strictly a 4-seater; the rear bench has very awkward seating for the middle occupant
No manual transmission even as an option!
Long term reliability of the DCT is a concern
Missing kit (auto wipers, steering reach adjustment...)

Introduction
Of all the car manufacturers in India, Hyundai was the last company that anyone expected to cater to the niche and minuscule enthusiast market in India. Yet, in the span of 1 year, Hyundai has launched not one, but two "N" inspired cars with a few more on the horizon. We say "inspired", because these N Line variants are not the full-fat double-cream "N" variants that have steadily gained popularity in the international markets, particularly in the European Union. That said, the Indian domestic market is clearly maturing enough for companies to consider introducing niche products that cater to an extremely exclusive segment.
Hyundai’s "N" division is now more decorated than ever before. With inputs from its WRC program and having poached BMW M Division’s head honcho, Hyundai is evidently serious about its N Division. For more dope on Hyundai’s "N" division, we urge you to read our
i20 N Line review published around this time last year.
The Venue N Line, strangely, isn’t the first hot/warm compact crossover to hit the shelves. Enthusiasts may remember Fiat's Avventura Abarth, which was essentially a Punto Abarth on stilts. Enthusiasts may also remember Ford's attempt at a fun compact crossover, ala the EcoSport S powered by their famous EcoBoost 1.0 3-pot turbocharged engine mated to a 6-speed manual transmission, along with 'S' specific trinkets. Hyundai, however, would be hoping that the Venue N Line has a far greater impact on the market than the Avventura Abarth or the Ford EcoSport S, as only a handful of these warmed-up compact crossovers are found prowling the streets today. While such cars are gaining popularity and widespread notoriety in other markets, fast crossovers are still in their nascent stage in India and their scope for success may prove to be boundless. The idea of a souped-up compact crossover is a fantastic one considering the poor and sometimes non-existent roads in the country, not to mention the numerous hillocks that masquerade as speed breakers.

Hyundai Venue N Line Price & Brochure
The N Line is available in 2 variants - N6 and N8 priced at Rs. 12.16 lakh and Rs. 13.15 lakh (ex-showroom, India), respectively. The dual-tone versions cost Rs. 15,000 more. We feel, compared to the equivalent variants of the standard Venue or even other sub 4-m SUVs, these prices are quite competitive considering what the N Line offers.

Exterior
The N Line variants of the Venue have been applied to the facelifted version of the Venue. Much like its hatchback sibling, Hyundai has gone to town with the lashes of red all over the Venue N Line's bodywork. While to some, it may look good and suits the ethos of the N branding, it may come across as a tad shouty and overdone to others. The massive, borderline-grotesque chrome grille up front does not help matters either as it looks hopelessly disproportionate and comical given the overall size and footprint of the entire car.
That apart, the Venue is a smart-looking car, especially in its facelifted guise with its sharper lines, squared-off stance and new tail-light assembly that extends across the width of the rear boot. N Line-exclusive touches include N Line badges on the front grille, side flanks and boot lid, N Line alloy wheels and, of course, the signature double-barrel exhaust tips peeking out from under the rear skid plate.
The Venue N Line comes in two single-tone colours - Polar White and Shadow Grey and three dual-tone colours - Thunder Blue with Phantom Black roof, Shadow Grey with Phantom Black roof and Polar White with Phantom Black roof. The new colour option called Shadow Grey is similar to the famous Nardo Greys and Chalk/Crayon Hues from European sports car manufacturers and not too different from the Steel Grey option of the erstwhile Skoda Octavia vRS 230, Hyundai’s new Shadow Grey is a real head-turner!

Interior
Much like the i20 N Line, the Venue N Line gets the same ol’ drab-ish grey and black plasticky interior but peppered with red accents like the red piping and red-chequered flag motif embossed on the black upholstery. The dashboard gets red ambient lighting and the sunroof helps alleviate some of the drab vibes by bathing the cabin in light. However, the real standout features are the fabulous N steering wheel with paddles and the N gear selector nicked from the i20N available in international markets. The Venue N Line also gets a rotary drive mode selector located behind the gear selector which allows you to switch between three driving modes – Normal, Eco and Sport. Interestingly, the i20 N Line does not get this rotary drive mode selector and we are not sure why?
In terms of space and general accommodation, the Venue N Line is no different from the regular Venue. The front seats are fairly snug, offering adequate lateral and under-thigh support. Three adults on the rear seat will be a squeeze, though acceptable for short journeys. The rear bench does recline just a little bit, making longer journeys a less cumbersome affair. The boot is large enough for a weekend getaway, and the rear bench benefits from a split-folding option, allowing good flexibility while transporting larger objects.

Driving the Hyundai Venue N Line DCT
1.0 T-GDI engine could have done with a little more poke. Hyundai tells us that the engine is already close to its limit and headroom for tuning is severely limited.
Fire up the familiar 1.0L 3-pot T-GDI motor and you are greeted by a distinct burble from the twin exhaust pipes. However, this exhaust note is not intrusive and can be drowned out by music or the A/C blower, if turned up. Hyundai mentioned that the Venue N Lines exhaust note is a smidge louder than the i20 N Lines and we agree with them.
Select "Normal" on the drive mode rotary selector, slot the DCT gearbox in "D", ease off the brakes, and the Venue N Line creeps forward albeit without the urgency one may expect from a torque converter-equipped automatic car. The burbly note from the exhaust continues as the DCT seamlessly works its way up to the higher gears. The tiny 1.0 T-GDI motor coupled with the DCT gearbox makes light work of city traffic while treating you to the muted thrum from the exhaust.
Select "Eco" on the drive mode rotary selector and the blue graphics on the instrument cluster turn green. The gearbox now hurries its way up through the gears with the intention to extract maximum fuel efficiency from the motor. The exhaust note gets a touch quieter as the car finds itself in the 5th, 6th and 7th ratios with minimal effort. It must be said that the drive mode selector exerts no influence on the exhaust note, which only quietens down as the DCT cycles to the higher rations and the revs drop to a relaxed 1,300 rpm. Kickdown response in Normal and Eco modes is slow as the gearbox takes a second or two to sort itself out before handing you the power.
As we made our way to the open road, the opportunity to explore "Sport" mode presented itself to us. Knocking the selector into Sport changed the green graphics in the instrument cluster to red, and all it took is one harmless prod on the loud pedal to wake up the drivetrain. The DCT promptly dropped a few gears and suddenly, we found ourselves in the meat of the powerband. Part throttle application is all that was needed to hustle the car to triple-digit speeds and the fruity exhaust note only egged us on even more! The gearbox, in Sport mode, is not as seamless as it is in Normal or Eco modes. Hyundai appears to have tweaked the gearbox to deliver a very mild yet deliberate jolt as the transmission holds onto lower gears and only upshifts much later in the rev-range, ensuring that the 1.0 T-GDI keeps delivering the goods. Shedding speed in Sport mode will influence the gearbox to drop a gear or two, to ensure that the engine is kept on the boil and the strong mid-range is available to the driver. Kickdown in Sport mode is discernibly quicker than in Normal or Eco drive modes, but not nearly as quick as one might expect.
Paddles behind the steering wheel allow you to take control of the gear changes - the left paddle allows you to drop a gear while the right paddle sends the transmission to the higher one. It must be said that the paddles are an absolute joy to use, and credit must go to their form factor and tactility. However, sustained punishment via the paddles is clearly not appreciated. The gearbox refused to downshift through the paddles after about 20 minutes of wringing the car by its neck. Calm driving for a couple of minutes allowed the gearbox to cool off and permitted the resumption of paddle-shift shenanigans.
While Sport mode is fun and the engine does not hesitate to deliver its power in the mid-range, several chinks in the Venue N Lines armour will surface when you are done playing with the gearbox and decide to rev it up to the redline (6,000 rpm). Above 4,000 rpm is when the exhaust note is somewhat drowned out by the coarse 3-cylinder engines thrum, and at around 4500 rpm is where you can feel the cars power dropping off a little. Go above 5,000 rpm and the 3-cylinder motor makes its presence felt in more ways than just the thrum, as the cars power appears to completely drop off. This 1.0 T-GDI motor does not enjoy being wrung to its limits and is most happy delivering its power between 2,000 and 4,000 rpm. Even the gearbox, in Sport mode, tends to upshift well before the revs creep to the redline.
While there may not be any real drama or push-back-into-the-seat feeling from this 1.0 T-GDI motor, there is no doubt that the Venue N Line is a competent expressway cruiser that delivers power in a linear and fuss-free fashion. In city limits, the Venue N Line is an absolute hoot to drive especially in Sport mode, as the gearbox downshifts frequently and the muted yet snarly exhaust note bounces off the walls and flyover ramps. Its a great point-and-shoot tool that takes little-to-no effort whatsoever to put a smile on your face. We thoroughly enjoyed blipping the throttle and dropping gears while navigating city streets and often found ourselves playing with the throttle and paddles just to listen to the exhaust note.
With that out of the way, it must be said that Hyundai has missed a trick or two while developing its N Line variants. We feel Hyundai could have done more to make the Venue N Line even more entertaining. A factory ECU tweak for a little more power or snappier gearshifts would have been welcome as this engine is mechanically no different from the one found in the Turbo variant of the Venue. We certainly think the N Line deserves a mild power bump to truly distinguish it from the regular Venue. And while the DCT is a great transmission, a manual option should have been offered for those who like to do the work themselves.

Suspension
The biggest compliment we can pay to the Venue N Line is that its suspension and steering are very un-Hyundai-like! The suspension particularly appears to be tweaked to deliver a sense of firmness that simply isnt characteristic of Hyundais. It is clear that Hyundai has fiddled with the shocks' valving in order to achieve the firmer damping and rebound actions, and it is more than just perceivable. This firmness is immediately observed while negotiating ruts and undulations on city roads. But this firmness does not make the ride uncomfortable as such, and only communicates the road surface to the cars occupants without tossing them around. The firm suspension is almost dismissive of ruts and undulations even at three-digit speeds.
On the open road, the Venue N Line feels quite settled at high speeds. It can feel a bit twitchy while switching lanes at speed, but that is due to the cars compact crossover ground clearance and perhaps, the short wheelbase. It is not as settled as its European counterparts, but its certainly an improvement over the regular Venue.
However, much like the drivetrain, chinks in the Venue N Line's armour will surface when the car is pushed hard. Body roll, although controlled to a degree, becomes pretty obvious. Again, this could be down to the added ground clearance and the extremely average MRF Wanderer Eco tyres.
The steering is not feather-light and dead off-centre as most of us may have come to expect from Hyundais generally. There is some heft & weight to the EPS, even at lower speeds. The steering isnt exactly sharp, but its accurate enough to keep you interested. However, the weighted steering simply does not inspire confidence while pushing the car around tight corners as it feels completely disconnected.
The brakes on the other hand are as good as they can get for a car of this size. All-round disc brakes will bring the Venue N Line to a stop fairly quickly and if it werent for the MRF tyres, the braking performance might have felt even more sure-footed. The brake pedal is sharp and takes a little getting used to, but once youve got the hang of it you wouldnt be short on confidence when emergency braking becomes necessary.
Hyundai has done a decent job in calibrating the steering and suspension to deliver a sporty experience. However, we cant help but feel that the changes are merely surface-level at best. Make no mistake, the Venue N Line is not a true "N" product and therefore, expectations must be tempered accordingly. The incremental changes the N Line variant brings with it, serve the intended purpose  provide the "N" flavour without the added calories and sugar. In that respect, the Venue N Line meets the objective.

Large squared-off radiator grille with chrome embellishments may too a tad too loud for some. N Line badging is almost lost in that sea of chrome. Silver skid plate gets N Line exclusive red insert.
Rear end is far more subtle, save for the red touches, N-Line badge and dual barrel exhaust tips. No fake exhaust outlets here and that's a relief!
Subtle side profile with red accents complementing the plastic cladding and of course, N Line badges on the fenders. The proportions of the N Line when viewed from the side are just right.
We suspect many enthusiasts will opt to wrap the chrome grille in gloss black.
Shadow Grey colour option really pops in the sunlight.
Vents at the corners of the front bumper help channel air around the front wheels. No fake vents here.
N Line exclusive 16" wheels deserve far better rubber than the factory-fitted 215/60 section MFR Wanderer EcoTred tyres. Red brake calipers are a nice touch.
Rear disc brakes are a welcome addition. However, the calipers ought to have been painted red to match the front brake assembly.
N Line badging and dual barrel exhaust tips help distinguish the car from the regular Venue.

Quality of leather and switchgear on the steering is top-notch.
Paddle shifters are finished in black.
Instrument cluster changes colour according to the selected drive mode. It is bathed in either blue (Normal), green (Eco) or red (Sport).
Doorpads get red stitching on the armrest to complement the rest of the red touches in the interior.
Front seats offer plenty of support and are comfortable even for longer drives. Red piping, red stitching and red chequered-flag motif are N Line exclusive touches.
Like the regular Venue, the N Line gets a 4-way electric adjustment for the driver's seat.
Aluminium pedals because it's the N Line.
Unlike the regular Venue, the N Line gets an auto-dimming IRVM.
Dual way dash cam with a 2.31-inch LCD display is a segment first and extremely handy in tricky situations.
Large infotainment screen dominates the dashboard.
N Line exclusive gear lever has been nicked from the European i20N and i30N models.
Rotary drive mode selector is finished in glossy black and gets a red outline.
Rear bench also gets red N Line highlights. Reclining rear bench and foldable armrest with integrated cupholders makes the back seat a comfortable place to be.
