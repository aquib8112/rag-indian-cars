Introduction
We all know the Audi Q7 as the all-rounder of SUVs. It is a car that can seat 7 people, has a nice V6 engine under the bonnet and air suspension for comfort. It does all the things right and that is also one of the reasons why it is an important car for Audi. The second generation was introduced in India back in December 2015 and a facelifted version was launched in 2022. In 2024, the car has received another facelift. The new generation will most likely come in 2026, but till then, we have this.
Audi has updated the Q7 with some modern-day features to bring it up to speed with its competitors, but the overall package is still the same. You get a 3.0L, V6 petrol engine that puts out 335 BHP and 500 Nm and is mated to a ZF 8-speed automatic gearbox. Power is sent to all four wheels through a Quattro all-wheel drive system.

2024 Audi Q7 Facelift Exterior Review
New front end does well in distinguishing the 2024 Q7 from the outgoing car. You get a new radiator grille with a thick chrome border and vertical chrome inserts. The bumper has also been redesigned.
Changes to the rear are more subtle. You get a new bumper design and also dual exhausts.
Not much has changed on the side except for the new 20-inch wheels.
In terms of dimensions, the Q7 is longer and higher than the outgoing car. It measures 5,072 mm in length (an increase of 8 mm), 1,970 mm in width (2,122 mm with mirrors) and 1,705 mm in height (an increase of 2 mm). It has a wheelbase of 3,000 mm (an increase of 1 mm).
The Q7 is a full-size SUV with good road presence.
Radiator grille houses Audi’s 2D logo. It also has vertical chrome elements which are a big differentiator from the outgoing car. Front camera is located in the middle just below the logo.
Audi’s Matrix LED headlights have integrated DRLs.
Vents at the ends of the bumper provide for additional cooling.
Long bonnet gets subtle creases.
Instead of the 19-inch wheels of the outgoing car, you now get 20-inch wheels.
Design of the new 5-twin spoke alloy wheel looks better than the outgoing model.
ORVMs get integrated LED turn-indicators. Side cameras (for the 360-degree display) are placed underneath.
New on the Q7 is the lane watch camera feature.
You also get a massive panoramic sunroof.
LED tail-lamps have dynamic turn-indicators. Blacked-out Q7 badge looks good. You no longer get an engine badge on the tailgate.
New rear bumper houses a silver skid plate and rear fog lamps. The dual exhausts with chrome tips look good.

2024 Audi Q7 Facelift Interior Review
If you’ve been in the previous Q7, you will find it really hard to find many changes to the interior. Not much has changed and you get a spacious cabin with a clean dashboard. On the centre console, you get a twin-screen layout and also Audi’s Virtual Cockpit. Overall, it’s a nice cabin with good-quality materials and ample space.
A simple-looking steering wheel is very nice to hold. You get paddle shifters at the back.
Audi’s virtual cockpit has a 12.3-inch display. While this MID is fairly advanced and has clear graphics and a bunch of options, it has started to show its age compared to the competition.
MID has a lot of features and the display is customizable as well. You now get the Lane Keep Assist feature, but you don’t get the full ADAS suite.
Big and comfy leather seats offer excellent support. The Okapi Brown upholstery has been replaced with Cedar Brown which is a slightly lighter shade, but not very different. The other option in the upholstery colour is Saiga Beige. You don’t get seat ventilation or heating, but there is a memory function.
The dual-screen setup. The unit on top is the infotainment head-unit while the screen below is for the A/C controls. You still don’t get wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. The infotainment system is mated to a 730W, 19-speaker Bang & Olufsen 3D audio system which sounds amazing.
Apart from the preset drive modes, you can also configure individual settings for the engine, suspension and steering. Notice the manual control for the air suspension on the right.
The Q7 gets 4-zone climate control and you can set the temperatures for the rear passengers as well from the touchscreen. On top, you have the buttons for auto start-stop, downhill descent control and park assist. Below the screen, you have the controls for drive select, traction control and front and rear defoggers. You also get a manual knob for infotainment controls and switches for more parking-related controls.
Below, you have two cupholders along with a 12V socket which also gets a lid.
Classy-looking transmission mode selector! Electronic parking brake and auto hold buttons are placed behind.
Centre armrest is wide and set at a nice angle. Underneath the armrest, you have a wireless phone charger which also doubles up as an Audi Phone Box. What it does is amplify the signal through the shark fin antenna of the car.
IRVM covers the entire rear windshield very well.
Passenger side of the dashboard features a large slab of piano black with a silver insert and "Quattro" lettering. Knobs to control the direction of the vents look odd on the piano black section.
Being a full-size SUV, there’s enough cabin width to seat 3 people in the back seat. Floor hump, however, makes it a bit uncomfortable for the middle passenger. Headroom is plentiful despite the sunroof and the seats offer good comfort as well. Under-thigh support is also good for tall passengers and the Q7 gets all the basics right.
With the front seat adjusted to my driving position, I had a healthy amount of knee room. Bosses can always have the front seat pushed all the way forward to free up more room. Unfortunately, you don’t have a boss button on the front left seat.
Middle passenger also gets an adjustable headrest.
Centre armrest is set slightly high and gets two retractable cupholders.
You get manual sunshades for the rear windows.
As mentioned earlier, the Q7 comes with a 4-zone climate control system. Below, you have a 12V socket and two USB-C charging ports.
Third row of seats are more of a novelty feature and they’re certainly not for adults. Kids can manage, but for short journeys only. You get 3-point seatbelts and adjustable headrests for both passengers.
Once you fold down the middle row of seats, you can see the controls for the third row just behind them.
With the third row of seats in place there is 295 litres boot space available.
This is how most people would be using the boot. There’s plenty of space with the third row folded down. You can even fold down the middle row of seats (40:20:40 split) for more luggage space.
No spare wheel. The space underneath the boot floor is taken by the subwoofer, amplifier and a puncture repair kit.
On the left, you have the controls for the air suspension to lower or raise the loading lip height. You can also fold down the last row of seats electrically.
Our test car came with these accessories for separating luggage.

Driving the 2024 Audi Q7 Facelift
Powering the Q7 facelift is the same engine that is found in the Q8 which we drove recently. Its a 3.0-litre V6 TFSI petrol unit that makes 335 BHP and 500 Nm. Its mated to a ZF 8-speed automatic gearbox that sends power to all four wheels through Audis Quattro all-wheel drive system.
The EA839 3.0L V6 TFSI engine also has a 48V mild hybrid system to assist it. It comes with Audi Drive Select with six customizable driving modes. This engine is shared with the Q8 and the base variant of the Porsche Cayenne and other vehicles such as the S5, etc.
As expected, the engine refinement at startup is excellent. At idle, it purrs quietly. This V6 is known for its butter-smooth nature and you will immediately understand why when you start driving. You dont need to use much of the throttle to get the car going. The engine does its job well and provides a good amount of torque and power in the city. The throttle calibration is just right and you can drive around in the city quite easily.
Get on the open road and the engine continues to impress. It gets to high speeds pretty quickly and theres never an issue with power delivery. Its still very linear and smooth and you can effortlessly cruise for long hours. This is not a car from which you should expect supercar-like performance. The V6 under the hood offers solid performance thats perfect for highways and long-distance cruising. It is fairly quick as well, 0-100 km/h is done in 5.6 seconds and the top speed is limited to 250 km/h. This means that your overtaking manoeuvres are easily taken care of.
The ZF8 Tiptronic gearbox, as always, does its job well, going through the gears quickly in comfort mode without making the shifts known. In the sportier settings, it holds the gears at higher rpms and provides some quick shifts. Overall, the engine and gearbox are paired well, and do what one would want, when one would want. So no complaints here.
The Q7 is not E20 compliant. The minimum octane rating for fuel is 91.

Suspension
Another big talking point on the Q7 is the air suspension which is also offered by some of its competitors. Switch the drive mode to Comfortable while driving in the city and the air suspension works beautifully. The low-speed ride quality is very compliant and the small potholes are absorbed with ease. The overall, the bump absorption is very good. There is some side-to-side movement over bad roads, but it is controlled. At high speeds, the ride quality remains compliant.
Switch to Dynamic mode and the suspension stiffens up noticeably.  Straight line stability is excellent. There is no unnecessary vertical movement and the Q7 maintains its composure very well. Chuck it hard into a corner and you will notice that there is some body roll and while the car manages to hold its line, its not very enjoyable. You can feel the big weight that you are carrying into the corners. The air suspension, though, is definitely a highlight for the Q7 as it isnt offered on the Q8 any more. So, if youre looking for a comfortable ride, the Q7 is clearly the one to go for over the Q8.
The steering is nice and light at city speeds. It weighs up well on the highways and even in Dynamic mode. The steering feels direct enough but doesn't relay much feedback. Its again focused on comfort which is something it does well. The brakes do a fair job of stopping the Q7 from whatever speed it may be doing and the pedal feel is good too.
