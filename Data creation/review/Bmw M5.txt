What you'll like.
Brutal acceleration and the crazy way it picks up speed
Supercar performance with practicality. Can seat 4 in comfort and do silly things
Leech-like grip levels & excellent braking capability. AWD gives it poise
It doesn't gather too much attention (some people like that)

What you won't.
Rear-wheel-drive mode is only with traction control disabled completely
After adding options, the price tag is a whopping Rs. 2 crores on-road
The body kit is a tad too similar to the regular 530d M-Sport
3.XX km/l! 70L tank gives it a range of just ~250 km if you drive it like an ///M

Introduction
The M5 has always been known to do things which no sedan should do. 100 km/h almost as quick as a Mclaren F1? A top speed of over 300 km/h? Let four people sit in comfort while doing the former? No problem! The M5 can get it done with ease. This latest generation M5 has high standards to keep up to. I think I can safely say that all the M5s in the past have been iconic in their own way.
The E28 introduced the world to the M5. It had a relatively calm 278 BHP straight-six and in terms of numbers produced, it is probably the rarest generation of them all. After that, we had the E34 M5, which continued with a straight-six engine and also brought in the wagon version. The next was the E39 M5, which looks absolutely gangster, and it was also the first to bring in a V8 engine. Get this - in 1998, the E39 M5 would cross 300 km/h when de-limited. Next in line was the F1 engine inspired V10 E60 M5. I dont really need to give an introduction to this iconic vehicle. Post that was the monstrosity known as the F10 M5, with its turbo V8 engine and rear tyre shredding torque. Its difficult to keep the F10 straight, and many felt it had too much torque going to the 295 section rear tyres.
So now, in comes the F90. Its got the big turbo V8 and power has been bumped up even further. Its grown larger in size, probably as much as a 7-Series from a couple of years ago. Its improved on the nimbleness and handling, which apparently had become a little less sharp in the F10 gen. And, its got all-wheel-drive. Wait, what? Yes, BMW has now given us the first M sedan with all-wheel-drive. For the M purists  its not that bad! Even though it is based on the G30 5-Series, it has F in its codename, which is the codename of the previous generation vehicle - strange.
The M5 we were given to drive was a special edition model. It is called the First Edition and is limited to just 400 vehicles worldwide. What is special about this is the colour, interiors, some options like the sports exhaust, and even the carbon ceramic brakes.

Exterior
Head on, the M5 looks aggressive thanks to the design of the bumper, though I do feel it looks a tad bit too similar to the regular M Sport bumper. Nevertheless, those who need to know will know from first glance that it is an M5.
The rear bumper is again pretty similar to the M Sport bumper, though this has a sporty looking diffuser in the centre and the quad tailpipe set up as with all M vehicles.
The side view is sleek and the vehicle is very well proportioned, I have to say. Notice the vents on the front fenders, which are exclusive to the M model.
The frozen red colour on this M5 is not a standard colour. But it sure does look nice with the way it varies the shade from deep red in the sunlight to dark maroon in the shade.
A carbon fibre roof is available as standard on the M5 now. If you want a sunroof, then there is no carbon fibre roof.
Optional 20" wheels in black with 275 and 285 section staggered tyres. The golden calipers mean this car has carbon ceramic brakes, which are optional. The CCBs are something else when it comes to stopping power from any speed.
An aggressive diffuser with 3 fins. BMW has definitely added some neat bits on this vehicle. Also note the black exhaust tips, which signify the M Sport exhaust. The optional M Sport exhaust gives out some loud pops and bangs when you lift off the throttle, though I wish it was a tad bit louder under acceleration.

Interior
The interior is a pleasant place to be. It is almost the same as the regular 5-Series, apart from the seats, the steering wheel, instrument cluster and the gear knob.
The driver's view sure is great. You can notice the heads up display cut out just above the cluster. BTW, the HUD in this is great, but I was surprised to find it a bit distracting at night on city roads as it has increased in size and therefore you may miss out some bumps or potholes which are very close to the vehicle.
The M multifunction seats with Merino leather in a special shade of white. These seats are very supportive and comfortable, and I love the various adjustments available. Ventilation and massage is an option, but this vehicle did not have it. Do note that the M5 badges in the headrest have a light inside.
The ceramic finish on the iDrive and other controls sure look and feel premium. The First Edition logo can also be seen. To the right is the M gear knob, with a P button for the first time. On previous M vehicles, only if the engine was switched off while in D would the transmission shift to P. Also note the auto hold button next to the handbrake, another first for the M5.
Over here, we can see the buttons for the drivetrain, suspension and steering settings, along with an exhaust button below which makes it a bit louder.
M gear knobs have a different shift pattern when compared to a regular automatic. I found the movement takes a bit more effort as compared to other vehicles where it would be a flick of the wrist to move it from N to D and vice-versa. Do note the M Drivelogic buttons on top of the shifter, a very logical and convenient location.
A new fully digital instrument cluster, which is clear and crisp. It does not have too many fancy graphics or show off stuff, but tells you exactly what you need to know.
Ambient lighting is used throughout and lends a great effect to the interior. Of course, there are various options and combinations in terms of colours, and I preferred the blue / purple seen here.
One of the best parts of the interior is how the Bowers and Wilkins tweeter is lit up. The B&W system sounds really good.
Its funny to see that this car has rear seat entertainment. Maybe it is just to keep the kids busy while the owner enjoys the drive. Then again, I have seen people in India sitting in the back of their M5 while the chauffeur drives them.

Driving the 4.4L Petrol AT
The F90 M5 carries over the 4.4L V8 from the F10. It gets some updates and a higher power output of 592 BHP @ 5,600 - 6,700 rpm. Interestingly, the F10 M5 made 592 BHP too, in the limited edition Jahre and Competition editions. The engine puts out 750 Nm of torque @ 1,800 - 5,600 rpm and powers all four wheels. Now, the all-wheel-drive system in this is a bit different from others. It, by default, sends all of its power to the rear wheels, and if needed, it transmits power to the front. The 0-100 timing has been recorded by various people at between 3.2 and 3.4 seconds, which frankly is ridiculous! Of course, its all due to the extra traction offered by the all-wheel-drive system.
Another big change, I would say, is the use of a conventional torque converter transmission. It is a ZF 8-speed called M Sport automatic transmission. The shift times are quicker than the standard 8-speed torque converter. Lock up happens very early, and it is also locked up most of the time so that the feel is more direct. The earlier M5 and M3 used dual-clutch transmissions, and the E60 M5 and the E46 M3 used single-clutch transmissions. While this transmission is brilliant in every way, the only time you would miss the DCT or SMG is during a gear change when going flat out. The automatic transmission just doesn’t have that ‘jhatka’ during the gear shift which really gives you a mechanical feel, in spite of the shift times now being faster than the DCTs.
Getting into the comfortable multifunction seats, the interior somehow feels familiar. The red M1 and M2 buttons stand out on the steering wheel. There is now a red engine start button too, and when you press that, the start-up sounds all too familiar! Flicking the gear shifter to the right into D, I let go off the brake and was surprised to feel the M5 move ahead. Even when the M division used the 8-speed in the X5M, the creep function was removed and you had to press the accelerator to move front, so it was quite a surprise to feel the creep in this. Moving on, driving in Mumbai city traffic, the M5 feels very comfortable and is not a struggle at all. The width is something to be watched out for, but apart from that, its easy to drive.
Driving sedately, the M5 feels completely at home. Its truly something which can be used every day. Turbo lag is non-existent, and seeing how it makes the 750 Nm of torque from 1,800 rpm onwards, this is not surprising. The gearshifts too are smooth and imperceptible, when the gearbox is left in one of the lower Drivelogic settings. But start hustling, and that’s when the M5 wakes up. If you have preset one of the M buttons like I did (everything in Sport Plus and traction in 4WD Sport), pressing it truly wakes the beast up. It feels like you are in a different vehicle. The way the F90 M5 accelerates needs to be felt to be believed. It pushes you back into the seat properly, and the push just gets harder all the way till the redline! The M5 seems to defy physics in the way it accelerates to jail-term speeds, and it is absolutely relentless.
What is truly special is the way the vehicle launches to a 100 km/h. With the earlier RWD sedans, the traction light would be blinking constantly till 100-120 km/h. With this, there is a blink or two in first gear and that’s it. Even on Mumbai’s dusty concrete roads, it just grips and goes! The all-wheel-drive system works seamlessly and you will never figure out when and how much torque is transferred to the front wheels. Its really tricked out. But at the same time, for M purists, having all-wheel-drive means a loss of one important thing – drama! Be it the E60 M5 or the F10 M5 or even the F80 M3, you know you’re in an M car when you’ve got to keep both your hands on the steering wheel when you accelerate hard, especially if the car is in MDM mode. With all-wheel-drive, the drama of having the tail lose and having to counter slightly with the steering wheel is gone. You can keep one hand on the steering and the M5 just goes! But at the same time, the kind of grip offered through corners is really, really good. You can start accelerating out of a corner with full throttle without a worry, whereas in a rear-wheel-drive car, the tail would surely kick out. So in terms of absolute speed, the all-wheel-drive system has given the F90 M5 a big boost.
In terms of ride quality, at low speeds, there is a bit of body movement. You feel every undulation on the road, but the suspension is well damped. It is never uncomfortable in spite of the 20” rims. As the speed picks up, the ride gets even better and it flattens small and medium bumps. On the highway, the ride is perfectly comfortable and I found nothing really lacking in terms of comfort. Of course, large bumps and potholes have to be watched out for, because of the low profile tyres. But on the whole, the M5 is very useable in the city and on the highways too.
Handling is great, and the grip levels are very high. It almost never seems to want to lose grip even when it is really pushed through the corners. I managed to get the tail out a bit in 4WD Sport only on two corners, and while it was predictable, I didn’t really enjoy it. 2WD mode was far better in that sense, but then again, you’ve got to really watch out since the traction control is turned off completely. The M5, on the whole, feels very agile and the steering is quick and communicative. It is also worth mentioning that the steering is fully electric, and I found it better in terms of feel than the F10 M5 steering, which was hydraulic. The chassis just feels really, really tight in spite of the size, and it feels a size smaller than it actually is when its being pushed.
So to conclude, the F90 M5 is supremely fast and practical, but misses out on a bit of the drama from the rear-wheel-drive M cars in everyday driving. But it makes driving fast very easy, and is certainly a great buy for those considering!
The menu where you set up the M1 and M2 buttons. For M2, everything is in the sportiest setting, but the suspension is in comfort for the terrible Mumbai roads.
This is where you select between 4WD and 4WD Sport (also puts the M5 in MDM), and 2WD, which switches the traction control off completely.
The red M1 and M2 buttons are right in your face, and I think this new placement of buttons is great.
