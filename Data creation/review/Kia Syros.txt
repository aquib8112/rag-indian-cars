Kia Syros Cons
Funky styling isn't to everyone's taste. You'll either love it or hate it
Firm suspension. Liveable, but bad roads will bother you (especially on 17" wheel variants)
Back seat's width makes it better for 2 adults and a kid, rather than 3 adults
Dual-clutch ATs (like the Petrol DCT) have a history of poor reliability in India
Buzz felt on idling in the cabin (1.5L diesel). Diesel’s engine noise could be better controlled too
Output from the Harman-Kardon sound system is just average
Have to mention the misses (thinner spare tyre on top trims, rain-sensing wipers…)
Cheaper & simpler 1.5L naturally-aspirated petrol isn’t on offer (nor is its butter-smooth CVT)

Introduction
As we already know, SUVs and crossovers are dominating the car scene in India. In fact, carmakers are introducing more models to cater to the needs of people in various price brackets.
Kia, which has not bothered making sedans or hatchbacks for India, believes that there is a gap between the 4.3 m long Seltos and the sub-4 m Sonet that can be filled. For this purpose, the company is gearing up to launch another crossover called the Syros. With this car, Kia is targeting business professionals and executives between the ages of 20 and 45 with an annual income of Rs. 15 - 25 lakhs.
Like the Sonet, the Syros is under 4 m in length, but it is loaded with many more features including many first-in-segment ones. The Syros also uses the more powerful engines from the Sonet. Kia hopes that these factors will help in making the Syros a successful product in the market.

Kia Syros Price & Brochure
The Syros is offered with two engine options - a 3-cylinder, 1.0-litre turbo-petrol and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel. The 1.0 turbo-petrol can be had with a 6-speed MT or a 7-speed DCT automatic, while the 1.5 turbo-diesel engine gets a 6-speed MT and a 6-speed torque converter automatic.
There are 6 variants – HTK, HTK (O), HTK+, HTX, HTX+ and HTX+ (O). The prices of the different variants will be announced in February 2025.

Exterior
Design & Styling
In terms of styling, the Kia Syros is pretty radical. It is based on Kia's Opposites United design philosophy. At first glance, it looks like a mix of many cars including the Tata Punch, Maruti WagonR, Skoda Yeti and more.
The Syros has a boxy, tallboy design with Kia's signature digital tiger face, vertically oriented Star Map LED DRLs that double up as turn-indicators, ice cube MFR LED headlamps (mounted on the bumper), matte silver front and rear skid plates, flared wheel arches, lots of black plastic cladding, 17-inch crystal cut alloy wheels, flush-fitting door handles, sharkfin antenna, roof rails, L-shaped Star Map LED tail-lamps, and vertically oriented bumper-mounted stop lamps and turn-indicators.
The Syros measures 3,995 mm in length, 1,805 mm in width, and 1,680 mm in height (with roof rails) with a wheelbase of 2,550 mm. This makes the Syros wider and taller than the Sonet and due to the unique styling, the car stands out in a crowd. It has a good road presence.
The Syros is available in a total of 8 monotone colours  Frost Blue, Intense Red, Glacier White Pearl (our test car), Imperial Blue, Aurora Pearl Black, Pewter Olive, Gravity Grey and Sparkling Silver.

Build Quality, Fit & Finish
The Syros is built on a reinforced version of the K1 platform that is used in Hyundai-Kia cars such as the Grand i10 Nios, Aura and Exter. The overall fit and finish is very good. The doors, bonnet and tailgate have a good amount of heft to them and theres hardly any flex in the body panels as well. Overall, the Syros feels quite sturdy and well-built.
That being said, the Syros has not been crash-tested by NCAP or other independent bodies.

Wheels & Tyres
The lower variants (HTK & HTK (O) petrol) get the 15-inch steel wheels with full covers shod with 195/65 section tyres. The mid variants (HTK+, HTX & HTX (O) diesel) get 16-inch crystal cut alloy wheels fitted with 215/60 section rubber. The top variants (HTX+ & HTX+ (O)) get 17-inch crystal cut alloy wheels shod with 215/55 section tyres. For the top variants, the recommended tyre pressure is 33 psi for the front tyres and 31 psi for the rear ones. If youre travelling with load (5 people and luggage), its 36 psi for all 4 tyres. The spare wheel is a 15-inch steel wheel with a 195/65 section tyre.

Ground Clearance
Kia hasnt specified the ground clearance of the Syros. However, it appears to be more than adequate for Indian conditions. Our test car had no issues tackling speed breakers and even some mild off-roading.

Standard & Extended Warranty
The Syros comes with a standard warranty of 3 years / unlimited km. You can extend the warranty up to 5 years and we highly recommend that you do so.

Maintenance
Kia has a nationwide Care network with the availability of genuine spare parts and IoT-based workshops with live vehicle tracking. Additionally, there is the Scratch Care program for one-time free repair. You also get a 24x7, 3-year RSA programme.

Safety
The Syros is loaded with safety features including Level 2 ADAS with 16 autonomous features, 6 airbags, ABS, brake force assist system (BAS), electronic stability control, vehicle stability management, hill-start assist control, TPMS, parking sensors, 360-degree camera, ISOFIX child seat anchors and more.

Interior
Cabin Design & Quality
Step inside the cabin and you can see a grey dual-tone interior theme and a 30-inch trinity panoramic display panel. You get cool blue & grey or black & grey interiors in the mid and lower variants respectively. There is a leatherette-wrapped Double D-Cut two-spoke steering wheel.
Overall, the design is quite straightforward and likeable. The quality of plastics used is good and nothing feels flimsy. While there is no soft touch material used on the dashboard, there is leather used on the armrests, and on the doorpads where your arms are likely to touch.

Space & Comfort
Ingress & egress is very easy thanks to the height of the car and the not-so-high floor. Though not very big on the outside, the interior of the Syros is spacious. The width, height and long wheelbase ensure that the car has substantially more headroom, legroom and shoulder room than the Sonet in the front and rear. Even so, like most modern cars, its still best for only 4 adults to travel comfortably. A 5th adult would not feel very comfortable.
The front seats offer good support. Theyre comfortable with adequate cushioning. You get leatherette upholstery on the HTX and higher variants. The quality of the leatherette is acceptable.

Driving Position & Ergonomics
The driver seat gets 4-way power adjustment and the steering wheel is also adjustable for height but not reach. Still, finding your perfect driving position is quite easy. The steering is nice to hold and thanks to the high seating and large glass area, frontal and side visibility is very good. All controls are exactly where you would expect them to be and within easy reach of the driver. We will say that ergonomically, the Syros is well sorted.

Cabin Storage
Theres a healthy amount of storage for the front passengers. All doorpads can hold a 1-litre bottle and some other stuff. The front doorpads can even hold an umbrella each. You get a medium-sized glovebox and a sunglass holder in the roof bezel. Additionally, you get a small storage pocket in the crashpad on the passenger side, two retractable cupholders on the centre console and some additional storage under the centre armrest. The front seatbacks have deep pockets for rear passengers to use with the left unit getting a smartphone holder as well. You also get a small cubby below the rear A/C vents, two on the rear doorpads just ahead of the power window switches and two cupholders in the centre armrest of the rear seat.

Air-Conditioning
The Syros gets an automatic climate control system. We drove the car in Gurugram on what was mostly a cool day. However, the sun did break in the afternoon. The air-conditioning unit managed to keep the cabin cool throughout. Rear A/C vents have been provided, and there is an air purifier as well. In what is a segment-first, both the front and rear (left and right) passengers get ventilated seats, which are great to have.

Features
Unique & Noteworthy Features
Kia has loaded the Syros with a large number of features. Noteworthy features include keyless entry & go, a 30-inch trinity panoramic display panel, all windows up/down through smartkey, remote engine start, electric parking brake with auto hold, a climate control system, a 2-spoke leatherette-wrapped steering wheel, paddle shifters, 64-colour ambient lighting, alloy pedals, ventilated front and rear seats, sliding and reclining rear seats, 8-speaker Harman Kardon sound system, drive & traction modes, navigation, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, Kia Connect with OTA software updates, sunshade curtains for the rear windows, extendable sunvisors, rear A/C vents, air purifier, 360-degree camera, dashcam with dual camera and a dual-pane panoramic sunroof.
You also get two USB charging ports for both rows of seats, a wireless charging pad, auto-dimming IRVM, puddle lamps, auto headlamps with escort function and more. However, rain-sensing wipers and glovebox illumination & cooling have been left out.

Audio System & Sound Quality
The 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system is mated with an 8-speaker Harman Kardon sound system. The touchscreen gets navigation and wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity along with voice commands in English and some Indian languages. In terms of usability, the touchscreen is very responsive and doesn't lag. Even the display is crisp.
The system allows several settings, but most users will find the audio quality ordinary. The sound is a tad bass-heavy and I did not find the output on par with some other premium systems that I have experienced.
The Kia Connect 2.0 telematics, which was introduced with the Carnival has made its way to the Syros. It offers features such as SOS emergency support, real-time diagnostics, and stolen vehicle tracking, among others.

Rear Passengers
Rear Seat Comfort & Space
Like the front, ingress & egress is easy due to the the height of the car. The long wheelbase and scooped-out front seatbacks mean that there is enough legroom for rear passengers. Two 6-footers can easily sit one behind the other. Then there is a neat party trick that the Syros has. The rear seats have fore & aft adjustment. You can slide them backwards in case you want some more legroom. Theres a very good amount of headroom on offer as well. Further, the seatbacks can be reclined considerably for added comfort and as mentioned earlier, the left and right seats are ventilated (seatbase only). Under-thigh support is adequate and the cushioning is neither too soft nor too firm.
On the negative side, the seat width is good for two adults and a kid only and while 3-point seatbelts have been provided for all occupants, only the left and right ones get headrests. Rear occupants get A/C vents and two Type-C USB ports for charging their smartphones.

Boot Space
The Syros comes with a 390-litre boot with the rear seats moved all the way back. If you move them all the way forward, you get 465 litres of boot space. You can further increase the boot space by folding down the rear seats. The loading lip is high though, and you will have to lift your bags to take them out. The boot gets a light and parcel tray. This boot is good enough to carry a small familys weekend luggage.

Driving the Kia Syros 1.5L Diesel AT
1.5L, 4-cylinder CRDi diesel fills the engine bay well.
The Syros diesel draws power from a 1.5L, 4-cylinder CRDi engine with a variable turbocharger. The motor produces 114 BHP (@ 4,000 rpm) & 250 Nm (@ 1,500-2,750 rpm). The engine is mated to a 6-speed torque converter AT. The outright performance of the Syros diesel is enough to keep most drivers happy.
On startup, there is a hint of body shake. The engine idles smoothly, but there is a slight buzz felt on the steering, pedals and centre console.
The Syros' diesel engine has excellent driveability! A light steering, soft controls & smooth shifting AT make the Syros a breeze to drive. The properly positioned dead pedal in the spacious footwell keeps your left leg comfortable. The car moves off seamlessly from a standstill & there is no lag to speak of. Light accelerator input is all you'll need to commute in the city. The gearbox moves up early, while the shift quality is very smooth. For bumper-to-bumper traffic conditions, there is a 'crawl' function available. Just lift your foot off the brake pedal in 'D' and the car will crawl forward at 6 km/h (without any throttle input), allowing you to drive in stop-and-go traffic with just one pedal (the brake).
The kickdown reaction time is good. Not just that, even if you give it part throttle, the gearbox willingly drops a gear or two to give you that extra push. The transmission responds well to throttle inputs. On the open road, the Syros AT offers brisk acceleration and never feels underpowered. With the foot hard down, the engine will rev till ~4,200 rpm. The Syros AT is a competent long-distance cruiser. The rev counter reads ~1,900 rpm @ 100 km/h.
You can shift gears manually by using the paddles behind the steering. It is useful when you want to prepare the car for overtaking on a 2-lane highway, or when you desire engine braking.

Drive modes
The Syros gets 3 drive modes - Eco, Normal and Sport.
Eco Mode - Engage the Eco mode when you want to extract maximum fuel efficiency. The throttle response is dulled, but given the power on tap, the mode is quite comfortable to use in the city. In fact, we prefer driving in this mode in the city as the car becomes a lot smoother to drive. Also, while driving in the city in Eco mode, we noticed that the gearbox wasn't downshifting easily when the accelerator was pressed. It wanted to stay in the higher gears to extract more fuel efficiency.
Normal Mode - This is the default mode and just as the name suggests, it's normal to drive. There is a slight difference between Normal and Eco mode. This mode can be used for day-to-day driving which has a mix of city and open roads.
Sport Mode - Engage this mode when you want the car to be more responsive to your inputs. The throttle response is sharper, and the transmission also holds on to gears a bit longer in this mode. The steering is also noticeably heavier. Sport mode isn't something you'd want to engage in the city as it can get a bit jerky to drive.
Additionally, the car gets 3 terrain modes - Snow, Mud and Sand.

Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH)
The Syros diesel does fairly well here. As mentioned earlier, there is a slight body shake on start-up and shutdown and there is a buzz felt on the steering, pedals and centre console at idle. At slow speeds and around town, the engine performs quietly. The engine gets loud above 3,000 rpm and screams above 4,000 rpm which can get tiring.
There is a hint of wind noise creeping into the cabin at 105 km/h. Road and tyre noise are well controlled.
No insulation under the bonnet.
Firewall insulation is sufficient.

Mileage & Fuel economy
The Syros diesel AT has an ARAI-certified fuel economy figure of 17.65 km/l, while the MT's rating is 20.75 km/l. On my test drive, the best figure I saw was 11.5 km/l, but then the drive included a lot of hard acceleration and braking along with long idling periods. Well wait for some ownership reviews to get a better picture of real-world fuel efficiency. The fuel tank capacity of the Syros is 45 litres.

Suspension
McPherson strut suspension at the front.
Coupled torsion beam axle at the rear.

Ride Comfort
The top variants (HTX+ & HTX+ (O)) get 17-inch crystal cut alloy wheels shod with 215/55 section tyres. The low-speed ride is on the stiffer side. You will know the surface on which you are travelling. The bumps on the road can be felt. Still, the ride is never harsh. At high speeds, the suspension remains compliant. Large bumps do come in sharply though.
The mid and lower variants come with 16-inch and 15-inch wheels with taller rubber. The ride in those should be cushier than the top variants.

Handling & Dynamics
The Syros straight-line stability is impressive. The car does not lose composure over bumps or road joints at higher speeds. Even undulations on the road are dealt with very well. We did not drive the car beyond permissible limits though.
Body roll is very well controlled for a taller car and the Syros changes direction without any unnerving incidents. The JK Tyre UX Royale tyres that our test car was shod with are fine at regular cornering speeds or even a little beyond. However, we did not do any hard cornering and hence, cannot comment on how they will perform on the limit.

Steering
The Syros gets a well-tuned EPS. It is light & smooth in the city. As the speedometer climbs, the steering feels reasonably direct and fast too. The fair all-around visibility, smooth automatic gearbox and light controls make this crossover easy to drive in urban conditions. On the highway, the steering feels stable and has no nervousness. If you want some more weight, switch to Sport mode although not as much as enthusiasts would like. Again, as is in the case of most EPS units, there is no feedback from the steering.

Braking
The AT variants of the petrol and diesel Syros come with disc brakes on all four wheels. The braking performance is strong and the car stops in a straight line sans drama when braking from high speeds. Emergency braking manoeuvres are also handled well. However, the brake pedal feels extremely sharp to the inputs. You need to be very gentle if you want to shed speed gradually.

Kia Syros Exterior Images
At first glance, the front of the car reminds you of some Tata designs. The front end is dominated by a large bumper that houses all the elements.
Boxy rear end with tail lamps placed at the top next to the windshield and the stop lamps and indicators on the bumper. Model and transmission badges have been pasted on the left and right lower corners of the tailgate respectively.
In the side profile, the Syros gives a very Skoda Yeti-like vibe. It gets flush-fitting door handles, roof rails and lots of body cladding giving it a rugged look. No chrome has been used anywhere on the car.
Wheel arches stick out like the Land Rover Defender. The overall styling is radical and you either love it or loathe it.
The Syros measures 3,995 mm in length, 1,805 mm in width and 1,680 mm in height (with roof rails). It has a wheelbase of 2,550 mm.
Vertically stacked ice cube MFR LED headlamps are mounted on the bumper. Vertically oriented Star Map LED DRLs double up as turn indicators. Headlamp cluster placement on the outer edge of the bumper means it is prone to scratches and damage.
Theres no traditional radiator grille here. You have a slim grille in the middle section of the bumper with a large air dam down below. The front camera sticks out from the upper grille and the bumper houses the front parking sensors, a radar sensor and a large matte silver skid plate.
Healthy underbody protection right at the front.
Bonnet has strong character lines. A slim piano black insert is placed between the bonnet and the bumper.
ADAS camera sits at the top of the front windshield, behind the IRVM. 16 ADAS Level 2 features have been provided. These include forward collision warning, forward collision avoidance assist, smart cruise control with stop & go, blind view monitor, lane keep assist, lane departure warning, high beam assist, driver attention warning and parking collision avoidance assist - reverse among others.
Body-coloured ORVMs get integrated LED turn indicators. They also get puddle lamps with Kia logo projection along with cameras for the 360-degree view system.
Flush-fitting door handles look great, but do not pop out automatically. You need to press the front end inwards with your finger to get the rear to pop out. This makes them a pain to use.
Fit and finish is top class. Panel gaps are consistent all over the car including the doors, bonnet and tailgate.
HTX+ & HTX+ (O) variants get 17-inch crystal cut alloy wheels shod with 215/55 section tyres. We found the design of the wheels too busy.
Rear disc brakes are available only in the AT variants of the petrol and diesel Syros.
Full cladding in the rear and partial cladding in the front wheel wells.
Notice how much the flared wheel arches stick out.
Black cladding with thick matte silver inserts on the lower portion of the doors.
Marking on the diesel filler cap indicates the car's diet. You can also see the AdBlue filler next to it. Fuel tank capacity = 45 litres.
B-pillar is very thick but the glass area is large. Notice how uniquely the windows are shaped.
HTK (O) and higher variants get thick matte silver bridge-type roof rails.
HTK+ and higher variants get a massive panoramic sunroof. The HTK (O) variant gets a regular unit.
Sharkfin antenna sits at the end of the roof section.
Tailgate gets a subtle spoiler at the top.
HTX and higher variants get L-shaped Star Map LED tail-lamps.
Clusters containing the LED stop lamps, halogen turn indicators and reflectors are placed on the outer edges of the bumper. These will be prone to scratches and damage.
Rear bumper houses the parking sensors and a matte silver skid plate with the reversing lamp in the middle. The rear camera is placed just above the number plate. The exhaust pipe is nicely concealed.
Apart from the Glacier White Pearl colour of our test car, the Syros is available in 7 more monotone shades. Here it is in Gravity Grey, Sparkling Sliver, Intense Red, Imperial Blue, Pewter Olive, Aurora Black Pearl and Frost Blue (signature colour).

Kia Syros Interior Images
Dashboard has a grey dual-tone theme. No soft touch material has been used anywhere, but the plastic quality feels good.
Windscreen is large and the seating position is high. I could see the bonnet in my driving position.
A-pillars are not thick and allround visibility is good. Tweeters are located at the base of the A-pillars.
Leatherette-wrapped Double D-Cut two-spoke steering wheel is nice to hold. However, its looks might not appeal to all.
Telephony and voice commands are placed on the right spoke while the buttons on the left spoke have the ADAS and MID controls. The traction mode and drive mode selectors are placed below the right and left spokes respectively.
Automatic variants get paddle shifters too.
12.3-inch instrument cluster is fully digital and easy to read.
Colour bands rise on the sides of the speedometer and rev counter according to the speed and revs.
Through the infotainment head unit, you can choose round dials for the instrument cluster display. The dials change colour according to the drive mode selected.
MID shows all the necessary information including a TPMS, urea level and turn-by-turn navigation.
It also shows a compass, ADAS-related functions and the drive and traction modes selected.
Left side of the instrument cluster warns if the conditions for engaging smart cruise control are not met. The blind spot monitor is also displayed in the instrument cluster. The auto hold indicator turns green when the function is engaged. One needs to press the brake deeper once the car comes to a stop for the auto hold function to be engaged.
Middle portion of the Trinity display is a 5-inch touchscreen showing the setting of the climate control system.
Stalks get piano black inserts. They exude quality and have a soft operation. Automatic headlamps have been provided, but rain-sensing wipers are not available on any variant.

Electronic parking brake and switches for the auto hold function traction control and headlamp leveller are placed below the A/C vent.
A thin yet sturdy bonnet release lever is located below the dash. Fuel flap release is placed conventionally on the floor.
Doorpad also gets a grey dual-tone theme. The armrest and area above it are draped in leatherette.
Doorpads hold brushed silver handles and switch for the seat ventilation and the front speakers. The console holds the switches for the power windows and ORVMS. All windows get auto up and down functionality. Door pockets can hold a 1-litre bottle, other small things and even an umbrella.
Rubber beading on the doors is of very good quality.
The door sills are not wide. No scuff plates here.
Seats are draped in leatherette upholstery. They get cooling function which is such a boon in hot India! The driver seat gets 4-way electric adjustability and manual height adjustment but doesn't get lumbar adjustment. Still, it provides sufficient support.
A close look at the perforated leatherette seat upholstery. The quality of materials used is acceptable.
Centre armrest has a soft leatherette cladding. While it is not adjustable, the armrest is conveniently placed and most drivers will find it comfortable to use.
Seatbelts aren't adjustable for height.
Spacious footwell with well-positioned pedals and a useful dead pedal too. HTX+ variant gets pedals finished in sporty aluminium with black rubber grips.
ORVMs are well-sized, providing a good view of the action behind. No blind-spot warnings here though.
IRVM is wide enough to cover the entire rear windshield. Rear headrests and thick D-pillars restrict visibility though.
IRVM houses 3 buttons - SOS will place an emergency call to Kia customer care, the button with the tow truck will call Kia Roadside Assistance and the third button will launch Kia Connect (telematics). Auto-dimming function has been provided as well.
Like most crossovers, the rearward view is average at best. The rear windshield is fair in size, but the C-pillars are thick. Better to rely on the reversing camera & parking sensors.
Centre speaker is located on top of the dashboard.
The 12.3-inch touchscreen has a crisp display and is very slick to operate. Visibility is good even under direct sunlight. Physical buttons for various functions have been provided below.

A close look at the different detailing on the dashboard.
Glovebox is medium-sized. No illumination or cooling here though.
Roof bezel consists of map lights and sunroof controls, Bluetooth mic and sunglass holder.
Sunglass holder has a soft lining to prevent scratches.
Sunvisors are economy-grade in design, yet they don’t feel flimsy. Passenger-side sunvisor gets a vanity mirror, while the driver-side unit merely gets a flap to hold tickets. Both sunvisors are extendable.
6 airbags are standard on all variants of the Syros. These include dual front airbags, side airbags and curtain airbags.
Large panoramic sunroof lets a lot of light into the cabin.
Rear doorpads get the same theme as the ones in the front. They house the rear speakers and the switches for the power windows and rear seat ventilation.
Storage spaces include a cubby just ahead of the power window switch and a door pocket that can hold a 1-litre bottle and other small stuff.
Pull-up sunshades have been provided in all variants. With sunfilms banned, these prove to be an effective way to protect yourself from the harsh sun.
Door sill is not wide and there is enough space between the B-pillar and seat base to move your feet in or out.
There's adequate legroom at the rear. Even taller occupants will have no trouble sitting one behind the other.
Front seatbacks are scooped out to liberate more knee room.
All occupants get three-point seatbelts. Only side occupants get headrests. These are adjustable. ISOFIX child seat mounts have been provided on both sides. As mentioned earlier, the left and right seat bases are ventilated.
Centre armrest is positioned at a comfortable height. It is wide & soft, and comes with two cupholders.
HTK+ and higher variants get a 60:40 split on the rear seat. Seatbacks can be reclined individually. Here's the difference in the angles between the reclined & regular positions.
In what is a segment first, the rear seats can be individually slid forward or backwards. Here is the difference between the full forward and full backward positions.
To accommodate the reclining and sliding, there is a wide gap between the parcel shelf and the rear seatback.
Small screen displays the air quality index inside the car. Rear air-con vents are provided on all variants.
2 Type-C USB ports at the base of the console for rear passengers to charge their smartphones. A small cubby next to it can be used to place a smartphone while charging.

Boot gets a small parcel shelf with a prominent lip, a light on the left and a subwoofer on the right. Tailgate gets a cladding on the inside.
Spare wheel in all trim levels is a 15-inch steel unit with 195/65 section rubber. The higher variants should have gotten a spare of the same size as the regular wheels.
Folding the seatbacks down gives you a much larger cargo capacity.
A look at the cargo space with the rear seatbacks folded and the seats pushed all the way forward.
