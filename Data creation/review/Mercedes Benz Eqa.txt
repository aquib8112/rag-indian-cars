Mercedes EQA 250+ Review

Introduction
Mercedes started introducing its electric vehicle range in India back in 2020. under the EQ sub-brand. The first product of the brand was the EQC SUV which was followed by the EQS Limousine and the EQB SUV. Mercedes discontinued the EQC in 2023 and introduced the larger EQE SUV in India.
Now, the company is entering the entry-level luxury electric SUV segment. It has brought the EQA to India to compete against the likes of the BMW iX1, Volvo C40 Recharge and XC40 Recharge. The EQA will be available only in a single variant - EQA 250+. It will be powered by a single motor, which puts it at a disadvantage when compared to its rivals. However, it must be noted that the EQA has sold more than 1,30,000 units globally since its introduction in 2021. Mercedes will be hoping to replicate its success in India as well.
What we are getting in India is the 2024 facelifted version of the EQA. It features a battery capacity of 70.5 kWh. Power and torque are rated at 188 BHP and 385 Nm respectively. It has a claimed WLTP range of 560 km.
The EQA SUV isn’t going to being assembled locally. Instead, it will be directly imported.

Mercedes EQA 250+ Price & Brochure
Mercedes will announce the price of the EQA 250+ on July 8, 2024. Since its being imported as a CBU, we do not expect it to be priced as well as the Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor, which is assembled in India.

Running Costs
The Mercedes EQA 250+ has a 70.5 kWh battery pack which translates to ~71 units of electricity for a full charge. The per-unit cost of electricity depends on the slab that you are in & your location, but on average, it’s about Rs. 8 per unit. This translates to Rs. 568 to charge to 100%. Mercedes claims a range of 560 km (WLTP). While we were not able to do a range test, you should be able to get a realistic driving range of 400 km. Thus, you can expect an approximate running cost of Rs. 1.42 per km.

Exterior
Design & Styling
The EQA is based on the GLA SUV and looks fairly similar to it. Changes include reworked LED headlamps and tail-lamps, chrome plated 3D star pattern front grille with a light bar above it connecting the headlamps, redesigned front and rear bumpers, new tailgate with a light bar connecting the tail-lamps and new 19-inch alloy wheels. Other features include silver roof rails, panoramic sunroof and black body cladding.
The EQA 250+ measures 4,463 mm in length, 1,834 mm in width, and 1,624 mm in height with a wheelbase of 2,729 mm.
There are seven colour choices on offer - Polar White, Cosmos Black, High-tech Silver, Mountain Grey, Spectral Blue, MANUFAKTUR Patagonia Red and a new MANUFAKTUR Mountain Grey Magno. All colours come with a glossy black roof.

Build Quality, Fit & Finish
As expected of a Mercedes, the build quality of the EQA 250+ is impressive. All the body panels feel sturdy and the doors, bonnet and tailgate have a good deal of weight. The panel gaps are consistent and the fit & finish is top-notch. The paint quality is as good as we've seen in this segment.

Wheels & Tyres
The EQA 250+ gets 19-inch 10-spoke AMG alloy wheels shod with with 235/50 section tyres. Our test car had Continental EcoContact 6 runflat tyres which provided excellent grip in the corners. The recommended tyre pressure is 40 PSI all around.

Ground Clearance
Merccedes hasnt specified the ground clearance of the EQA 250+. However, it appears to be more than adequate for Indian conditions. Our test car had no issues tackling speed breakers and bumps on the road.

Standard & Extended Warranty
The EQA 250+ comes with a warranty of 3 years. It gets a battery warranty of 8 years / 1,60,000 km warranty.

Safety
As expected of a Mercedes, the EQA is loaded with safety features including 7 airbags, TPMS, PRE-SAFE speed limit assist, adaptive high beam assist, active lane keeping assist, active blind spot assist, forward collision warning with active brake control, 360-degree camera, acoustic presence reminder and ISOFIX child seat anchors among others.
The EQA has been given a 5-star crash-test rating by Euro NCAP.

Interior
Cabin Design & Quality
The EQA 250+ has an identical dashboard design to the GLA. It is all-black and the overall design looks modern and contemporary which is typical of Mercedes cars. You get a twin-screen layout with a customisable 10.25-inch instrument cluster and a 10.25-inch touchscreen. The A/C vents have turbine blades that are finished in rose gold.
Soft-touch materials have been used at various places and the interiors are solidly put together. There aren't any rough edges anywhere in the cabin. Like most Mercedes cars, the part quality is very good.
The carpets and roofliner are black as well. Overall, the cabin quality is very good and most owners will be impressed.

Space & Comfort
Ingress & egress are easy and you can just walk into the car without difficulty. The space inside the cabin in the front seats is good and despite the black interiors, you never feel claustrophobic.
The seats are draped in black Artico leather and rose gold fabric upholstery. Like other parts, the quality of the upholstery is good. The seats offer very good support. They have side bolsters, which provide good lateral support. Both front seats get height & lumbar adjustment along with adjustable headrests. They get memory functions as well as Mercedes seat kinetics which makes minute changes to the inclination of seat cushions and backrest. What is sad is that these seats do not get ventilation, which is a big miss in a country like India.
The seatbelts are adjustable and leather has been used on the doorpads and centre console where the occupants of the front seats would rest their arms. This adds to the comfort.

Driving Position & Ergonomics
Frontal visibility is excellent. The rear visibility is compromised by the thick C-pillars and a small windshield though. You will have to use the camera while reversing.
Both front seats are electrically adjustable, get lumbar adjustment and memory function. Finding the perfect driving position is easy as the steering gets tilt & telescopic adjustment.
In the driver's seat, those who are used to Mercedes cars will be able to get acquainted with all the controls pretty quickly. The three-spoke, flat-bottom leather-wrapped sports steering is perfectly sized and nice to hold, but the horn pad is not easy to reach with your thumbs. The steering mounted buttons are touch type and the light / wiper stalk and gear lever are within easy reach. A useable dead pedal has been provided as well. We’ll say that the ergonomics are sorted in this car.

Cabin Storage
There are many storage spaces in the cabin. You get a glovebox with a soft lining and doorpads that can hold a 1L bottle along with some other items. The centre console houses two cupholders and a wireless smartphone charging pad and a USB Type-C port. Under the centre armrest is a deep storage compartment with two USB Type-C ports.
Rear passengers get seatback pockets that can hold a 1L bottle and small articles. The seatbacks of the front seats have storage nets to keep magazines. 2 Type-C USB charging ports have been provided below the rear A/C vents with a slot to keep a smartphone above and a small storage space next to them. There is a centre armrest with two retractable cupholders.

Air-Conditioning
The EQA 250+ comes with a dual-zone climate control system. The A/C did a very good job of cooling the cabin. However, it must be noted that we drove the car in rainy conditions and cannot comment on how the A/C will perform on a very hot and humid day. The system also comes with a charcoal fine particle filter.

Features
Unique & Noteworthy Features
The EQA 250+ comes loaded with features including ambient lighting, a panoramic sunroof, adjustable head-up display, hands-free tailgate, LED headlamps, smartphone connectivity, a wireless charger, front seats with electrical adjustments, extendable seat bases and memory function, seat kinetics, auto adaptive headlamps, rain-sensing wipers, adjustable regeneration, dual-zone climate control with fine particle filter and connected car technology.
On the other hand, a spare wheel has not been provided. Also missing are features such as the Vehicle-to-Load mobile power supply function, which the Korean manufacturers and even some Indian manufacturers provide.

Audio System & Sound Quality
Mercedes offers an 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment head-unit with the latest MBUX: NTG 7 telematics. The user interface is simple and easy to get used to and the display is crisp and clear. It's extremely smooth and seamless in operation. It gets Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, Mercedes me connect with over the air updates, gesture control MBUX Connect features and "Hey Mercedes" powered by AI, live updates via Car2X,  3 customized displays – discreet, classic, sporty, EQ specific displays and functions, live traffic information, augmented reality navigation and Alexa and Google voice integration.
It’s paired with a 710-watt Burmester 3D surround sound system with Dolby Atmos. Music is played through 12 speakers. In terms of audio quality, it's very impressive. At any volume, the audio quality is commendable with great clarity and no vibrations or distortion.

Rear Passengers
Rear Seat Comfort & Space
The doors open sufficiently wide and the roof is higher than a sedan or hatchback. So getting in and out of the rear is not difficult. You get 3 adjustable headrests and 3-point seatbelts for all 3 passengers. However, the floor hump is tall and wide. This along with the hard backrest in the middle (due to the centre armrest) and rear A/C vents means that an adult third passenger in the middle won’t be very comfortable. A child might be able to bear it though.
There’s a good amount of knee room and adequate headroom for rear passengers. The backrests are set at at a comfortable angle. The cushioning is spot on and the seats should be comfortable over long drives. However, like in most EVs the floor is high. This results in a knees-up seating position and many will complain about a lack of under-thigh support. Rear passengers get a centre armrest with two retractable cupholders, seatback nets, A/C vents, two Type-C USB charging ports.

Boot Space
The EQA 250+ has a boot space of 350 litres with the rear seats up. The 60:40 split rear seats can be folded down to increase cargo space. Unlike most other EVs, the EQA does not have a frunk.

Driving the EQA 250+
No frunk at the front. No plastic cover for the components either.
The EQA 250+ comes with a 70.5 kWh lithium-ion battery pack mounted on the floor of the car. Powering the car is a single electric motor that puts out 188 BHP and 385 Nm. It is mounted at the front and drives the front wheels.
To bring the electric motors to life, you need to press the brake and press the engine start/stop button.
Step on the accelerator and the car moves forward gently. There are no jerks from gearshifts and no sound from the engine, which means it is an extremely refined experience. Driving the car in city traffic is a breeze. There is enough power on tap to keep up with the traffic and close a gap to the vehicle in front quickly.
On the open road, the EQA 250+ provides fair performance. However, you will not find it very exciting, especially if you have driven the dual motor Volvo XC40 Recharge. Mercedes claims a 0-100 km/h sprint time of 8.6 seconds - 1.3 seconds slower than the XC40 Recharge Single Motor and 3.7 seconds slower than the Volvo's Dual motor version. It is still brisk though. Floor the A-pedal and you will moved ahead of most other cars around you without much difficulty. The top speed is claimed to be 160 km/h.
The EQA 250+ Recharge can easily cruise at triple-digit speeds on the highway and when you need to overtake a slower vehicle quickly, just floor the A-pedal and romp past the vehicle. However, the harder you drive, the faster the range drops. This is also why you will see EVs that are driving longer distances sticking to the middle lane and cruising at 80-100 km/h (which is the best cruising speed for the current lots of EVs).
The EQA 250+ comes with 4 driving modes - Comfort (default), Eco, Sport and Individual. These modes alter the throttle response.
The Comfort mode is the default mode which is in between the middle of Eco and Sport modes. It works well in town and on the highway and offers a good balance between range and performance.
In Eco mode, the throttle response is lazier. This mode provides the smoothest ride, especially in the city where traffic is thicker. However, it is not suitable for use on the highway where you might need to overtake a vehicle quickly.
In Sport mode, it's the opposite. Even with a light dab of the throttle, the motor responds. On undivided highways, this is the mode to use to pull off quick overtakes. The steering firms up too. However, using this mode in the city is not advisable as power delivery can get spiky.
Individual mode gives you the option to customise your driving experience to your requirements.
No insulation under the bonnet but full insulation on the firewall.
Full underbody protection.

Regenerative Braking
The EQA 250+ comes with 4 levels of regenerative braking - Normal, Strong, Maximum and Intelligent. You can switch between these three levels by using the paddles located behind the steering wheel. The Normal level is not very noticeable and if you have the car in this mode, you might end up using the brakes a lot. On the Strong and Maximum levels, the braking gets progressively stronger.
The Intelligent recuperation mode can be engaged by keeping one of the paddles pulled. In this mode, the car decides how much braking should be done depending upon the traffic on the road. While it works pretty well on the highway where the traffic is flowing fast and  smooth, it can catch you out on city roads.

Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH)
Like most EVs, the EQA 250+ is super quiet. Theres no engine or gearbox to make any noise, so the overall driving experience is silent.
Cabin insulation is top class and wind noise and tyre / road noise are well controlled. Overall, the cabin is a quiet and comfortable place to be in.

Range
The Mercedes EQA 250+ has a WLTP-certified range of 560 km. We drove the car for ~150 km and used up ~45% of the battery. But then our driving included some really fast runs, hard acceleration, idling and playing around with the drive modes and regen levels. Driven more sensibly, you can expect a range of ~400 km.
Given the rising demand for EVs, there are plenty of charging stations popping up everywhere, which ought to take care of range anxiety as well. There are more than 1,000 charging points in India that can be located via the FICH App. Mercedes itself has set up more than 150 charging points in the country.
Charging
Mercedes claims that using the standard 11 kW AC charger, a full charge should take 7 hours and 15 minutes. The car can also be charged using a 100 kW DC charger. The company claims that this can charge the battery from 10% to 80% in 35 minutes.

Suspension & Ride Comfort
The Mercedes EQA 250+ The GLA gets MacPherson struts at the front and a multi-link suspension at the rear. As you would expect from a European car, the setup is on the stiffer side and you do feel a lot of the road. A big contributor to this is the 19-inch wheel size of the AMG Line accompanied by 235/50 section runflat tyres. Thats not a very tall profile to provide a cushy ride. While the suspension can handle small bumps and potholes you can still feel them in the cabin. Large potholes should be handled with more caution.
The recommended tyre pressure is a rather high 40 PSI. Dropping the pressure might help improve the ride.

Handling & Dynamics
As expected from a German car, the straight-line stability is excellent and occupants won't even know that the car is cruising at triple-digit speeds. Expansion joints on the highway do not unsettle it. Vertical movement is well-controlled as well.
On long curves, the car holds its line well. When you push it on twisty roads, the stiff suspension shows its benefits. There is very little body roll and the car changes direction without fuss. Our test car came with 235/50 R19 Continental Contact 6 runflat tyres, which provided enough grip for the power on tap.

Steering
The EQA gets an electric power steering, which is very user-friendly. It's light in the city and most owners will appreciate that. The light steering and automatic transmission make the car very easy to drive in the city. At higher speeds, the steering weighs up well. There's no nervous feeling or twitchiness at all while cruising on the highways. The feel is consistent and the steering is very predictable. On the twisty roads, it relays a good amount of feedback.

Braking
The EQA is equipped with disc brakes at the front and rear. The braking performance is strong and the car comes to a halt without any drama. Under hard braking too, the car doesn't lose its composure. Mercedes has equipped the EQA with Active Brake Assist.
