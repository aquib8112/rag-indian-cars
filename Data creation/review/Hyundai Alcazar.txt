Hyundai's wide dealer & service network

Hyundai Alcazar Cons
2nd row legroom is mediocre (captain seat variant). Compromises have been made to accommodate the 3rd row & boot
3rd row access is too difficult in the captain seat variant
3rd row seat is best suited to kids only. Not really a place for adults
Competitors like the Carens, XUV700, Scorpio-N, Safari & Hector Plus offer more spacious cabins
No all-wheel drive option available for enthusiasts / overlanders
Long-term reliability of the 7-speed DCT is a concern (related reading)
Turbo-petrol revs to just ~5,750 rpm. It's a powerful motor with 158 BHP on tap, so we wish it went higher for driving pleasure
Diesel’s 114 BHP & 250 Nm – although adequate – are the lowest in the segment
A few misses (no sunroof and spare wheel in the diesel, wireless Android Auto & Apple Carplay, illuminated window buttons etc.)

Introduction
The Hyundai Alcazar was launched in India in 2021. It was a stretched version of the Creta and could carry 6/7 occupants. While it was a very competent car, it could not set the sales charts on fire like some other 6/7-seater SUVs in the market. Still, it has been a consistent performer and Hyundai's only 6/7-seater SUV. This makes it an important product in Hyundai's model line-up.
Earlier this year, Hyundai gave the Creta a series of updates. Now, it's the Alcazar's turn to get a facelift. For 2024, the SUV gets changes to the exterior and interior along with the upgraded turbo-petrol powertrain. These changes are in line with the updates to the Creta. The Alcazar facelift is available with two engine options: a 1.5-litre diesel that puts out 114 BHP and 250 Nm, offered with a 6-speed MT or 6-speed AT and a 1.5-litre turbo-petrol that produces 158 BHP and 253 Nm, available with either a 6-speed MT or 7-speed dual-clutch AT.
As expected from a Hyundai, the refreshed Alcazar is loaded with features. These include ADAS Level 2 with 19 autonomous features, 6 airbags, all-round disc brakes, dual-zone climate control, ventilated first and second-row seats, boss mode, 360-degree camera, panoramic sunroof, Bose sound system and more. Then, there is the Digital Key with NFC technology. With a touch of a smartphone or smartwatch against the door handle, customers can lock or unlock the car. They can place the smartphone/smartwatch on the front wireless charger pad to start the vehicle. The technology also allows the customer to drive and share the Digital Key with up to 3 different users or up to 7 linked devices at a time.
Additionally, Hyundai claims to have used advanced high-strength steel and hot stamping in the construction of the Alcazar for better crashworthiness.

Hyundai Alcazar Price & Brochure
Hyundai has launched the Alcazar facelift at prices starting from Rs. 14.99 lakhs (ex-showroom) for the turbo-petrol and 15.99 lakhs (ex-showroom for the diesel). Both petrol and diesel versions come in Executive, Prestige, Platinum and Signature variants. The top variants of both petrol and diesel are priced at Rs. 21.55 lakhs (ex-showroom). We feel the Alcazar is fairly priced for what it offers.

2024 Hyundai Alcazar Interior Review
The interior is largely similar to the 2024 Creta.
Dashboard is identical in design and function to the Creta facelift. In the Alcazar, you get dual-tone noble brown and haze navy interiors.
As expected of a Hyundai, the interiors are nicely finished. The instrument cluster and infotainment head unit are part of one big unit. It looks seamless and feels like a neat integration. It is set at a nice height below the top of the dashboard, which means that it doesn’t hamper the driver’s visibility.
Leather-wrapped 4-spoke flat-bottomed steering wheel has been carried over from the outgoing car. It's adjustable for height as well as reach, making it easy to get a good driving position. Brushed silver insert on the bottom two spokes has been replaced by piano black. Buttons for the infotainment system, telephony and voice commands are placed on the left spoke. Buttons on the right spoke now have the ADAS controls.
Paddle shifters are offered on all automatic variants.
10.25-inch floating-type digital cluster is identical to the one we've seen in the Creta. It has a crisp display with some neat customisation options.
The display theme can be set to change according to the drive mode selected. You can even choose from 3 terrain modes.
The Alcazar comes with ADAS Level 2 with 19 autonomous features. The display for some of the functions comes up in the MID. Turn-by-turn navigation is also shown here.
Parking sensor display comes up on the right dial as soon as the reverse gear is engaged.
Every time you start the turn-indicator the blind spot monitor function is activated.
In typical Hyundai fashion, wiper controls are placed on the left and light controls on the right. The Alcazar gets rain-sensing wipers and automatic headlamps.
The portion to the right of the instrument cluster is magnetic and you can have something stuck on it like a fridge magnet.
Slim A/C vent gets a silver insert.
Engine start-stop button has been placed below it along with some other controls. You have the switches for the idling start-stop system, traction control and parking sensors along with the headlamp leveller.
Door pad remains the same, except for the new interior colour theme.
Driver seat gets memory function. Switches for the same are located on the door pad.
Door sills get black scuff plates with thin chrome inserts.
Seats are draped in brown and hazy navy leather upholstery. Both seats are 8-way electrically adjustable and have ventilation, but you still don't get a lumbar adjustment. As mentioned earlier, the driver's seat gets a memory function.
Passenger seat can be moved forward and its backrest adjusted by the rear passenger using these buttons.
A closer look at the perforated leather upholstery.
Motor and other bits under the seat are left exposed. Should have had a plastic cover.
Footwell and pedals are identical to the outgoing car.
Alcazar branded floor mats are thick and of good quality.
ORVMs come with a blind spot warning system.
Electrochromic IRVM is identical to the outgoing car. However, the detailing on the buttons has been changed.
Layout of the centre fascia is identical to the Creta facelift. It features a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment head-unit at the top, a dual-zone climate control console in the middle and a wireless charging pad at the bottom with Type-C & Type-A USB ports and a 12V power outlet.
Here’s the front central speaker on top of the dashboard for the Bose 8 speaker sound system.
10.25-inch HD touchscreen is identical to the one in the Creta facelift. It has a crisp display and is very slick to operate. Visibility is good even under direct sunlight. There are different settings for the driver assistance system and you can choose to turn off the ones that you don't want to use. You have different vehicle-related settings as well for the lights, door, climate control and even the cluster. You also get voice commands and in-built music streaming application JioSaavn (with 1-year complimentary subscription). You also have 70+ Bluelink Connected car features with 16 free OTA (over-the-air) updates. Additionally, you get on-board navigation, 12 language UI support and 10 ambient sounds of nature. While you get Android Auto and Apple Carplay, it is not wireless.
The 360-degree camera feature is very usable while parking in tight spaces. The display is clear and there’s no lag.
Unlike the Creta facelift, switches for most of the climate control and touchscreen head-unit functions are touch type and not physical.
Gear shifter is carried over from the outgoing car. However, the glossy black console has been replaced by a brushed aluminium unit.
Switches for the seat ventilation have been redesigned. The switch for the 360-degree camera has been moved ahead on the centre console and sits just behind the auto hold button. Hill descent control has been added to the Alcazar's list of features. Its switch is placed on the centre console.
Slot on the dashboard has a rubberised base to keep things in place. The ideal place to keep your smartphone. Ambient light illuminates this area at night.
Well-sized glovebox is ventilated.
Roof bezel is similar in design to the outgoing car. However, the detailing is slightly different. It still incorporates a sunglass holder and the Bluetooth mic.
Panoramic sunroof is available in the Prestige, Platinum and Signature variants of the turbo-petrol version only. Along with the spare tyre, it has been left out of the diesel version to keep the kerb weight and price down.
Just like the front doors, the rear doors get a dual-tone theme with a leather-wrapped area to rest your elbow.
Switch for the seat ventilation function is placed on the door pad.
Just like the front, door sills get black scuff plates with thin chrome inserts.
6-seater versions of the Platinum and Signature variants get captain seats for the second row. They are nicely shaped and offer good support. They feel firmer than the front seats which is something people will appreciate on longer journeys. Backrests can be reclined as well. Further, the ones in the Signature variant are ventilated. These are the best seats in the house.
Second row has adequate legroom for most users.
Captain seats are very comfortable with good under-thigh support and bolstering. They get fore & aft adjustment there is sufficient knee room and headroom for most users. With the captain seat pulled moved all the way back, two 6-footers can sit one behind the other with just enough legroom.
Seatbases of the captain seats can be extended for additional under-thigh support. Taller occupants will love this.
Centre console has been deleted and the captain seats get individual foldable armrests. These could have been wider but seem to be compromised as ingress to the third row is from between the captain seats.
Captain seats get wing-type headrests. They are adjustable for height and extremely comfortable.
Seatbacks of the first row seats are scooped out to liberate more knee room.
Seatbacks get tray tables with retractable cupholders.
Rear A/C vents have been carried over from the outgoing car.
Below the A/C vents are two Type-C USB charging ports and a wireless charger with a removable tray.
This is as far forward as the second-row captain seats can move and tilt forward.
The only way to get to the third row is from between the second-row captain seats. This makes ingress & egress very difficult for adults.
Third-row seats are unchanged.
Seatbacks are split in a 50:50 ratio and can be reclined to the user's liking.
Space & comfort continue to be poor. The last row is strictly for children. For an adult to get into the rear, one has to move the second row seat all the way forward. The Alcazar must be viewed as a "5+2" car only.
Seatbacks of the second-row captain seats are scooped out to provide additional knee room.
Type-A USB ports have been replaced by Type-C units.
Boot space is rated at 180 litres. With the third row folded, you get 579 litres of luggage space.
Amplifier is placed next to the tools.

Driving the Hyundai Alcazar 1.5L Turbo-Petrol DCT Automatic
The 2024 Alcazar is powered by the same 1.5L turbo-petrol engine as the Hyundai Verna and Creta and the Kia Seltos and Carens. It produces an impressive 158 BHP (@ 5,500 rpm) and 253 Nm (@1,500-3,500 rpm). This 1.5L turbo-petrol engine is available with a 7-speed DCT automatic or a 6-speed MT. While the MT is available in the Executive, Prestige and Platinum variants, the DCT is available in the Platinum and Signature variants.
Fire up the engine, and it's refined at idle, silently purring away. Hyundai-Kia powertrains have always set NVH benchmarks, and this car is no different. Shift to D or R, and it moves off the line smoothly. Without any throttle input, the car crawls at 6 km/h. Crawling at city speeds isnt very dramatic and the 1.5L is very well-behaved. With light to medium throttle inputs, you can go about your daily commute quite comfortably. The throttle response is smooth and power delivery is linear. The 7-speed dual-clutch transmission is also seamless moving through the gears. Start driving and you will appreciate the healthy low-end of this engine. Thanks to the turbocharger and direct injection, youre never at a shortage of power. Just floor the accelerator if you want to close a gap in traffic or make that quick overtake and the engine and gearbox will do the rest.
Get on some open roads and you can let the Alcazar stretch its legs. Put your right foot down and before you know it, youll hit triple-digit speeds. Outright acceleration is good, but not as urgent as some other 1.5-litre turbo-petrols that we have driven. Hyundai claims a 0-100 km/h time of 9.5 seconds. The turbo delivers a strong mid-range punch that will take care of all the overtaking on the highway. You can cruise along the highway at 100 km/h while the engine spins at a relaxed ~1,850 rpm. Even at 120 km/h, the engine felt relaxed with the rev counter reading ~2,250 rpm. The Alcazar won't break a sweat cruising at these speeds all day long.
The dual-clutch transmission moves through the gears seamlessly. The kickdown response time is quick enough and the gearbox doesnt hesitate to drop down the gears to get the engine into the powerband. When you are in the mood for some fun, switch to Sport mode and start flipping the paddle shifters for manual control. The ECU matches the revs which is always very satisfying. While the overall NVH package is good, the engine doesn't sound very sporty at high revs. Hyundai has restricted the maximum rpm to ~5,750, which is too low, and the engine sounds a bit strained at this rpm. The paddle shifters are responsive, and you can extract some performance from the engine using them for quick overtakes or keeping the engine in the powerband. You can engage the gearbox "S" mode by sliding the gear lever to the right (when in D) and this makes the gearbox hold on to the gears a bit longer. You can also take control of the gears using the paddle shifters and manually keep the engine in the power band.
The Alcazar gets 3 drive modes - Eco, Normal and Sport.
Eco Mode - Engage the Eco mode when you want to extract maximum fuel efficiency. The throttle response is dulled, but given the power on tap, the mode is quite comfortable to use in the city. In fact, we prefer driving in this mode in the city as the car becomes a lot smoother to drive. The Auto Start-Stop feature is activated automatically when you select the Eco mode. Also, while driving in the city in Eco mode, we noticed that the gearbox wasn't downshifting easily when the accelerator was pressed. It wanted to stay in the higher gears to extract more fuel efficiency.
Normal Mode - This is the default mode and just as the name suggests, it's normal to drive. There is a noticeable difference between Normal and Eco mode. This mode can be used for day-to-day driving which has a mix of city and open roads.
Sport Mode - Engage this mode when you want the car to be more responsive to your inputs. The throttle response is sharper, and the transmission also holds on to gears a bit longer in this mode. The steering is also noticeably heavier, although not as much as enthusiasts would like (more on this later). Sport mode isn't something you'd want to engage in the city as it can get a bit jerky to drive.

Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH)
The 1.5-litre unit is very refined overall. At city speeds as well as while cruising at 100 km/h, you can barely hear the engine in the cabin. Even the vibrations are well controlled and cruising with the family on the highway should be comfortable.
Tyre noise does creep into the cabin at highway speed and there is a hint of wind noise at speeds above 100 km/h.
Mileage & Fuel economy
The Alcazar comes equipped with an Auto Start-Stop feature that helps fuel efficiency in city driving conditions. The ARAI-certified fuel efficiency for the 1.5-litre turbo-petrol DCT is 18.0 km/l (17.5 km/l for the MT) which is substantially better than the 2.0-litre NA petrol of the old outgoing car (14.2 km/l). Of course, the real-world FE numbers will be much lower considering that turbo-petrol DCTs are very sensitive to the driving style. Well wait for some ownership reviews to get a better picture of real-world fuel efficiency. Fuel tank capacity remains the same at 50 litres and the refreshed Alcazar is E20 compatible.
Bonnet gets insulation underneath and helps keep the noise levels low.
Sufficient insulation on the firewall.
Healthy amount of underbody protection.

Suspension & Ride Comfort
The Alcazar rides on a McPherson strut suspension up front and a torsion beam setup at the rear. Start driving and you will immediately notice that the Alcazar rides in a comfortable manner. Low-speed ride quality is acceptably absorbent and even large potholes are handled well. IMHO, the suspension tune is perfect for a 6/7 seater like the Alcazar. It's neither too soft, nor too stiff.
The Alcazar rides on 215/55 section tyres on 18-inch wheels and has a recommended tyre pressure of 33 PSI (35 PSI - full load). The Executive and Prestige variants riding on 215/60 R17 tyres will offer a cushier ride.

Handling & Dynamics
Out on the highway, the Alcazar stays composed. Its road manners are neutral, just as you would expect from a 3-row family crossover. Straight line stability is good and you can cruise at highway speeds quite comfortably. However, it doesn't ride as flat as the Creta and high-speed undulations do make the car feel a bit wallowy.
Throw the Alcazar around a corner and it responds better than you'd expect from a 6/7 seater. Yes, there's body roll, but it's controlled. On curves, the car will hold its line pretty well. Good to know that all variants are equipped with ESP which can be a lifesaver in emergencies. The grip levels from the 215/55 R18 JK tyres are average. BHPians looking to extract some performance might want to upgrade to richer Michelin or Yokohama rubber.

Steering
The Alcazar gets a well-tuned EPS. It is one-finger light & smooth in the city. As the speedometer climbs, the EPS feels reasonably direct and fast too. The good all-round visibility, smooth gearboxes (automatics in particular) and light controls make this car easy to drive in urban conditions. On the highway, the steering feels stable and has no nervousness. However, we would have liked a bit more feedback from the steering.

Braking
Hyundai has made all-wheel disc brakes standard across all variants. Additionally, you also get brake assist and ABS. While braking at high speeds, the car stops in a straight line without any drama. No complaints in the braking area.

Niggles & Problems
The standard warranty of the Alcazar is 3 years/unlimited km which can be extended up to 7 years. You also get 3 years of roadside assistance. There are also 5 years of running repair and maintenance packages that you can opt for.
While most of the recent feedback about this 1.5-litre turbo-petrol has been positive, the turbo-petrol engine with the dual-clutch transmission is something you should be careful with. Our test car threw up a "Check Engine" light during the drive. We ran a check on the vehicle diagnostics and it told us to visit an authorised Hyundai dealer for inspection. This is the first time I have spotted a problem in a Hyundai test car.
Its very much advisable to go for the maximum extended warranty. Dont even think about it twice. Its better to be safe than sorry.
