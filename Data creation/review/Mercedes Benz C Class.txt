Mercedes C-Class Cons
C200 petrol’s 1.5L drivetrain feels just about adequate. Best for chauffeured use or for calm owners
There is no bigger or more powerful petrol engine option (like the C300d)
Rs 55 - 61 lakh ex-showroom pricing is stiff! We find it overpriced
Boot space (already at a premium) is drastically impacted by the spare wheel on the floor
Better as a 4-adult seater than 5
BMW’s 330i is the more fun-to-drive petrol sedan
IMHO, the faux leather seats just don't cut it at this price point (3-Series gives real leather). No ventilated seats either
Styling is more of an evolution than a revolution. Also, looks very similar to other sedans in the Mercedes range
While it’s not unusual for premium sedans, you need to be careful on bad bumps. This car with 4 people and luggage bottomed out a few times during ourMussoorie drive

Introduction
Mercedes had lined up every generation of the C-Class starting from the W201, which dates back to 1982 up to the most recent W205.
The W201 was never really called the C-Class but was called the Baby Benz model series, although the spiritual DNA of the C-Class is clearly visible even in it. It was only from the W202 onwards that the model was formally christened the C-Class. That generation ran from 1992 until 2000.
The C-Class made its India debut with the W203 generation, back in 2001. The W206 will be the fourth model of the C-Class to be sold in India.  It was the W205 that marked the design shift towards its bigger siblings and earned the tag of Baby S. The W206, continues the design evolution of the Baby S look. It clearly has a more mature and evolved design over its immediate predecessor.
Emulating the S-Class is not limited to just the external and internal looks. Mercedes has stated that the new C-Class derives a host of its innovations and digital advancements from the flagship S-Class such as the latest (second) generation MBUX NTG 7.0. It definitely carries a sophistication that seems a class above its immediate competition. The hi-resolution central display too is inspired from the S-Class and sports an 11.9-inch LCD touch screen and Car to X communication technology. Given our limited time with the car, we could not, of course, try some of these features out.
All in all, visually, both externally and internally as well as in terms of the level of tech available, it is fair to say that the W206 sets the benchmark in this segment for others to follow.

Exterior
The W205 brought about the most significant change in the design language of the C-Class and was the first iteration which earned it the title of "Baby S". The W206 continues that progression for the C in a more 'evolution' over 'revolution' approach, nevertheless incorporating marked improvements in the car overall, which is evident both inside as well as outside. It's hard to fault the design whatever angle the car is shot in and the increased proportions give it an even more mature look.
The distinct Mercedes family look. One can argue it looks too similar to the other Mercedes cars today.
Keeping if classy. A sole C200 badge at the back gives the rear a clean, uncluttered look. Notice the trim styled to look like fake exhaust tips on the lower part of the bumper, which is, again, very similar to the W205.
Viewed side on, its perfect proportions are evident.  Also one can really see here that it's quite an evolution of the W205 design, though with the added length visible.
Front three quarter view. It is difficult to choose between the current BMW 3-Series and the C-Class. Both are handsome designs, but with their distinctive family look. However, with each newer BMW adopting ugly oversized radiator grilles, the stage is set for Mercedes to comfortably win in the exterior looks department.
Signature Mercedes tail-lights at the rear.
Classy looking headlight design, continuing the "Baby S" theme.
Radiator grille is a distinctive feature, with the vertical Maybach-esque vertical slats.
A closer look at the front bumper. I daresay the lower section looks a bit drab with all the black plastic and could have done with some aluminium trim.
The two lower Avantgarde trims gets 17" alloy wheels with a design that is nothing to write home about. For a car that is otherwise a design statement, I think they could have done better. The 17" wheels shod with 225/50 section MOE run flat tyres provide a fairly supple and comfortable ride. The C300d gets 18" alloys with a different design.
Sharp LED tail-light design, again, continuing the evolution of the design language.

Interior
The interiors are definitely a step up from previous generation's and in line with their more recent offerings. Most materials in the car are premium to touch and feel. Overall, the cabin is an extremely plush place to be in with the increased dimensions reflecting in the additional space available for front as well as rear passengers. The large iPad like vertically oriented infotainment head-unit is fairly intuitive to use.
Large bold pin stripes on the front dash certainly add a unique touch. They can be a touch polarising though. Some owners may prefer a more discreet look and while it does look grand initially, we can imagine a bold pinstripe finish something one might outgrow over a period of time.
Dashboard is distinct detailing and designed to give a rich and luxurious feel. The surface was fairly hard to touch though and as we mentioned before, we're not sure if such a bold design would be to everyone's taste. That said, it is, for now, likely to please more people than offend them.
Drivers cockpit area is well laid out and pleasing to look at and be in.
Steering wheel follows the design theme of newer Mercedes models. The array of buttons can seem a bit busy but once you're used to them, you'll find that it's handy to have most of the controls offered on the steering wheel itself. The sliders though, are a hit or a miss as many a time they don't pick up movements and one has to repeatedly attempt to register a movement - similar issue to the S-Class. I think all newer Mercedes steerings will have this issue. Do note the steering adjustment is electric, which was present in the W204, but missing in the W205.
Bright and clear instrument cluster, but without any 3D option like in the S-Class. It's still a pleasure to look at and displays all relevant information.
You have the option of displaying the maps on the instrument cluster, if you wish.
Service menu display shows all the important information one would need. I don't understand why Mercedes doesn't allow one to switch the tyre pressure units to PSI. Would make many chauffeurs' lives much easier.
Rotary light switch and the handbrake switch placed conveniently. Anyone who has driven any Mercedes of late will be comfortable right away with all controls in familiar positions.
Doorpad houses the seat and window controls and even the boot release. Switches for the mirrors have a touch like operation. The seat adjustment switches are similar to the S-Class, where you touch the area you want to adjust rather than the switch itself moving. Note that there are memory settings for the driver and passenger seats - something missed on the last-gen vehicle.
Burmester sound system does its job well. The Burmester 3D system on the C300d would be much better though.
Front seats are extremely comfortable and supportive with a host of electronic adjustments including under-thigh support. The headrests are electronically adjustable for height too - a segment first feature.
Center facia looks good. Everything exudes quality. Interiors have been something Mercedes has been acing off late.
Air-con vents have a beautiful modern design with ambient lighting.
Seat kinetic settings (for the driver and front passenger seats) are interesting. When activated, the seat moves just a bit every now and then so that the driver (or passenger) is not in the same position for extended periods. The change in position is really very minor and not intrusive at all while driving.
Many settings for the ambient lighting, including multi-colour options. Mercedes does ambient lighting the best.
The car is equipped with Active Brake Assist. We're still not convinced that this is apt for Indian conditions. Both Axe77 and I had some unsettling moments when the Active Brake Assist unexpectedly kicked in while driving in traffic. We tried to simulate the same situation again, but we couldn't. Overall, it will certainly take some getting used to for people unfamiliar with the feature.
Well designed cupholders. Wireless charging pad on the front right is designed such that the phone remains in place when it's charging.  A USB C port for Apple CarPlay connectivity has been provided.
Deep storage compartment under the center armrest is felt lined and has two USB C ports.
Touch controls for the sunroof. One has to slide his finger over the switch area to use it. Check out the cool textures and ambient lighting around the panel which gives it a floating appearance.
An area where the new C-Class has shown the biggest improvement over the W205 is the space in the rear. The new car is 65 mm longer in length and has a 25 mm longer wheelbase. The increased length has been well utilised in providing much better leg room for the rear passengers. I'm well over 6' tall and could comfortably sit in the rear with the front seat adjusted for myself. The headroom was poor though. Notice the sunshades provided for the rear windows, and one for the rear windshield, which is electrically operated. BMW has stopped giving these of late on the 3-Series.
Boot space, like most cars in this segment, is moderate at best.  Unlike the BMW 3-Series, which now has a raised floor under which the space saver is kept, the C-Class carries its space saver on the boot floor like its bigger siblings - extremely inconvenient for stowing luggage on those long road trips. Between the four of us sharing the car, the boot was pretty much filled up with our luggage and camera equipment.

Driving the 1.5L Turbo Petrol AT
On this drive, we drove the C200 petrol. Though we will certainly have a follow up post for the C300d, which will be the enthusiasts' choice, the C200 is what we managed to get our hands on.
This C200 has a 1.5L engine, which generates 201 BHP and 300 Nm. It comes with a 48v mild hybrid system. The mild hybrid part of this is an integrated starter generator that sits between the engine and the transmission and takes over the role of the alternator and starter. It can also provide a power / torque boost.  When quick acceleration is required, the electric motor helps by providing up to 20 BHP and 200 Nm of torque. It also helps with energy generation when it's not giving any output in terms of power / torque. This also functions as the starter and I have to say, the start-up is super smooth and non-intrusive. This is possibly one of the few cars in which I didn't feel the need to turn off the idling start stop simply due to the smoothness of it all. All 3 engine options in the W206 C-Class come with this system.
The W205 facelift had the same 1.5L engine with the EQ boost feature and ISG, but I think, it may have been discontinued after a while, though I'm not really sure why. That was slightly lower on power at the time though.
Sitting in the driver's seat, it all felt a little familiar. Firstly, because of the new vertical screen and the instrument cluster, which was reminding me of the S-Class we drove a few months ago. Secondly, the driving position and overall dimensions / visibility reminded me of the W205 C-Class. It feels more like an evolution than a revolution.
This drive was in Mussoorie, which meant a lot of gradient changes and lots of twisties. There were enough bad patches of road thrown in too, to give us a realistic judgement of how the C would behave in most conditions.
Pressing the engine start / stop button felt like it did nothing, until I noticed the RPMs were a shade below 1,000 and the engine was idling. There was no starter noise or even slight vibrations upon starting.
Getting a move on, one wouldn't immediately notice or feel that the engine is downsized. The EQ boost (additional power / torque provided by the ISG) helps at low rpms and low speeds in hiding some amount of turbo lag and adding a bit of pep. So the vehicle responds like it has a 2L engine. While driving around with part throttle, the drive train is silent and refined and one will have to strain oneself to hear any engine noise at all. The car moves in a relaxed manner, never really lacking in power or torque.  However, the moment you ask for a little more, you can hear the 1.5L engine straining a bit, even though the C-Class does move reasonably quickly. This strained noise probably wouldn't have been present in a 2L engine. It is one thing which is a bit off putting for me being an enthusiastic driver.  Though apart from the perceived strain due to the noise, the C200 isn't slow by any means and does get going. I'm certain though, that the C220d will be a better drive for enthusiasts, apart from the much more powerful C300d of course.
The 9G-Tronic gearbox, which is now a Mercedes staple, does the job well and without being intrusive at all. Shifts are smooth, and apart from taking maybe a tad longer than I would have liked for kickdown, it doesn't seem confused and is usually in the correct gear that one would need. In this plain Jane C200, it probably isn't calibrated for the enthusiast and it shows. Personally, I prefer the ZF8 of the BMWs. The 9G-Tronic gearbox now also has a coast function, where it completely disconnects from the engine (due to the ISG being in the middle), and the engine is actually switched off. One can see the engine coming back on as the speed reduces or once acceleration is requested. One aspect which was a bit disappointing was the response of the paddles, which I found slow.
With the 17" wheels and the tyre pressures a bit high (hovering around 39 psi), the ride quality was surprisingly well damped. While the W204 C-Class was very supple and settled, the W205 was a bit clunky when it came to the ride. Since the W205, the C classes have had MOE tyres (Mercedes term for runflats) and this W206, in spite of having them, didn't produce any clunks or thuds while tackling even larger bumps, which was very nice. In this sense, it does feel like a baby S-Class simply because of the silent way in which the suspension works and the overall mature feeling of the ride.
I have to mention, the stability over bad roads which is excellent and the C-Class just ate them up even when we went over them at a slightly higher speeds than we should have. It was unfazed. Once the speed picks up, the ride flattens out even more and high speed stability is good too. What surprised me was that when we pushed it a bit, the chassis felt like it wanted more, which was unlike the previous C-Class cars I have driven. In spite of the underwhelming drive train, pushing the W206 around the twisties was fun with the steering relaying a good amount of feedback and body roll being negligible. It's no BMW when it comes to handling, but let's just say that Mercedes is getting close!
Overall, I'll have to say the C-Class has matured and it feels like an excellent all-rounder in terms of ride, handling and even the drive (though the 200 wouldn't be my choice of drivetrain).
