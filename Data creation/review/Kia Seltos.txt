2023 Kia Seltos Facelift Review

Introduction
It’s safe to say that anyone looking for a mid-size SUV is somewhat spoilt for choice these days. There are just so many cars currently competing for the top spot and each one has something unique to offer. However, Kia Seltos has been a consistent performer in this segment and the 2023 facelift just builds on the existing legacy.
Kia made a smashing entry into the Indian market with the Seltos as their first product in 2019. However, since then there hasn't been a major change in terms of the product and the car remained relatively the same. We finally have the first refresh in 2023 and Kia has gone with the ‘Don't fix what’s not broken’ approach on this one. And it makes perfect sense as the Seltos at the time of launch was a car that was mechanically sound, loaded with features and well-priced for what it offered. In the 2023 facelift, Kia builds upon this strong foundation.
You have 3 engine options – a 113 BHP, 1.5-litre naturally aspirated (NA) petrol, a 158 BHP, 1.5-litre turbo-petrol and a 114 BHP, 1.5-litre turbo-diesel. You get a 6-speed manual transmission with the 1.5 NA petrol engine with an option of a CVT automatic. The 1.5 turbo-petrol can be had with a 6-speed iMT or a 7-speed DCT automatic. Lastly, the 1.5 diesel engine gets a 6-speed iMT as standard and the top-end variants can be opted with a 6-speed torque converter automatic. In essence, there are 3 engine options, 2 types of MT options, and 3 types of automatic gearboxes on offer. Additionally, there are 7 variants, 8 monotone body colours, 2 dual tone colours, 1 matte finish colour, 6 interior colours & seat patterns, and 5 alloy wheel designs. So when Kia says there’s something for everyone, they mean it.

Kia Seltos Price & Brochure
Prices for the 2023 Seltos start at Rs. 10.90 lakh for the 1.5-litre NA petrol and go to Rs. 16.60 lakh for the HTX variant with the CVT automatic. The 1.5-litre NA petrol with the CVT transmission is unfortunately not available in the top-end HTX+ / GTX+ / X-Line variants. This means that it misses out on some of the features like the 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, wireless charger, ventilated seats, 8-way powered seats and most importantly ADAS functions (GTX+ & X-Line). As Hyundai did with the Verna, Kia should’ve offered the 1.5 NA petrol on the top-end variant as well. This would also help Kia draw some customers from the Toyota HyRyder and Maruti Grand Vitara, which have a combined monthly sales figure of ~10,000 units.
The 1.5 turbo-petrol prices start at Rs. 15 lakh for the 6-speed iMT in the HTK+ variant and go up to Rs. 20 lakhs for the DCT automatic top-end X-Line variant. The Seltos diesel prices start at Rs. 12 lakh and go up to Rs. 20 lakh for the top-end AT in the X-Line trim. You can check the
detailed price list here.
In this segment, we would say that the Seltos is priced well considering what it offers. Comparing the prices of the top-end variants, it is the costliest in the segment, but not by much. The Skoda Kushaq and VW Taigun are close, but they don’t offer ADAS features.

2023 Kia Seltos Facelift Exterior Review
The Seltos retains the aggressive front face and has very similar design cues as the pre-facelift version. What’s new is the aggressive front tiger nose grille which has grown in size and the bumper has been redesigned as well.
Changes to the rear are significant, but just like the front, carries forward some essential design elements. You now have connected LED tail lamps on a redesigned tailgate. The rear bumper also gets a new design and houses reflectors and reversing lamps.
Not many changes to the side profile except for the length of the car which has gone up by 50 mm and now measures 4,365 mm. The wheelbase (2,610 mm) and other dimensions of the car (Width = 1,800 mm and Height = 1,645 mm) remain the same.
Kia claims that the new Seltos has a reinforced occupant compartment that makes it safer and more reliable. Also, a lot of the safety features are now standard across all variants. We will wait for the GNCAP test results of the new Seltos to comment on the safety aspect.
This is the top-end X-Line variant which comes exclusively in this Matte Graphite paint shade. A lot of the chrome elements have been blacked out on this variant. The paint finish is really good and the car looks great in person.
Kia calls these ‘Dazzling Crown Jewel’ LED headlamps. You have turn indicators down below and the LED DRL strip runs from the indicator pod to the headlamp pod and continues over the grille.
You now have sequential turn indicators.
A closer look at the new Tiger nose grille. The LED DRLs run across the middle instead of being on the top edge of the previous car. The front camera also sits higher up than before.
Here’s a look at the redesigned bumper of the GT Line and X-Line. The Tech Line gets a different design (keep reading). The Seltos facelift is equipped with ADAS Level 2 tech. Its front Radar sensor sits in the middle of the bumper. ‘Ice Cube’ LED fog lamps have been carried forward, but you get 4 cubes instead of 3 now.
Gloss black ORVM cover with integrated turn indicators and side camera.
The X-Line and GTX+ variants come with 18-inch crystal cut alloy wheels shod with 215/55 section tyres. While the alloy wheel design is nice and most people won’t complain, I prefer the older design.
Rear wheel disc brakes are standard across all variants.
Here’s a look at the 17-inch crystal cut alloy wheels of the HTX and HTX+ variants. They’re shod with 215/60 section tyres.
A welcome feature on the Seltos is this panoramic sunroof. Note that the shark-fin antenna now has a more aerodynamic design.
HTX+ variants and above get a glossy black spoiler.
You now get these taller taillamps that are now full LED.
They also get sequential turn indicators.
The LED tail lamps are connected from end to end. This looks much better than the earlier version’s chrome strip.
A look at the redesigned bumper. You get reversing lights and reflectors at the bottom. Yes, those are dual exhaust pipes and…
they’re not just aesthetic, they're functional.
Here’s a look at the front of the Seltos Tech line variants. It features a different bumper design with a brushed silver skid plate. The car in this picture is the Imperial Blue paint shade.
Similarly, the rear bumper gets a different design. You don’t get the dual exhaust setup here, instead, there’s a simple skid plate design. The reversing lamps and reflectors have also been repositioned.
Kia has introduced this new Pewter olive shade with the facelift.
Here’s the Seltos in Sparkling Silver paint shade.
This is the Intense Red paint shade. Other colour options include Clear White, Gravity Grey, Aurora Black Peral and Glacier White Pearl .

2023 Kia Seltos Facelift Interior Review
Changes to the interiors are subtle but noticeable. You get a very contemporarily styled dashboard with a large display panel that includes a touchscreen and a digital instrument cluster. In the X-Line variant that you see here, you get all-black interiors with Sage green inserts. Lower variants get 5 additional interior colour schemes and seat patterns.
The flat-bottom steering wheel has been carried forward from the previous Seltos. It has contrast red stitching and is a nice unit to hold and operate. It gets tilt and telescopic adjustment.
MID and ADAS-related controls are placed on the right spoke. Also, note that the Seltos automatic variants get paddle shifters too.
The driver gets a 10.25-inch fully digital instrument cluster. It has a typical 3-pod display which is customizable. The display is crisp, and you can get a lot of information from the screen.
Most importantly, you get ADAS-related information displayed on the screen. You also get trip-related information like distance travelled, distance to empty, etc. TPMS is standard across all variants.
As mentioned earlier, the display is customisable and you get different colour themes in different driving modes  Eco, Normal & Sport.
Heres a nifty feature thats an extension of the 360-degree camera setup. When you switch on a turn indicator, the feed from the corresponding ORVM camera is displayed on that side of the MID pod.
The Seltos is equipped with ADAS Level 2 tech with 17 autonomous features. The system features one front and two rear RADAR sensors which allow it to have features like forward collision avoidance assist, smart cruise control, blind spot collision avoidance, rear cross-traffic collision avoidance, etc. Heres the display with adaptive cruise control engaged.
Like the previous Seltos, you get a head-up display. Whats new is that it now also displays ADAS-related information.
While the side air vent design and the engine start / stop button remain the same, the buttons next to it have been rejigged. You now get an auto idle start / stop button along with traction control, head-up display and headlamp leveller.
The doorpad design remains the same and heres how it looks in the new Sage Green colour scheme.
Window controls are now backlit and note that all the windows now get auto up and down feature.
A look at the X-Line trim 'Sage Green' leatherette seats with a chevron pattern. Front seats are ventilated, which is a boon in our conditions. Under-thigh & back support are satisfactory. On the downside, those with a heavy build might find them a size too small.
These are brown leatherette seats that are available on the HTX+ variant.
Driver's seat is 8-way electrically adjustable but you still don't get a lumbar adjustment. The design of these switches is new and they feel sturdy & durable. Finding a comfortable driving position is super easy.
Aluminium pedals look sporty.
The blind-spot monitoring system works well and can even detect bikers precisely.
IRVM is wide enough to cover the entire rear windshield. Rear headrests and thick C-pillars restrict visibility though.
It houses 3 buttons - SOS will place an emergency call to Kia customer care, the button with the tow truck will call Kia Roadside Assistance and the third button will launch Kia Connect. An auto-dimming function has been provided as well.
Center fascia largely remains the same barring the new touchscreen, the sleeker central AC vents and the HVAC controls are also new.
This is the new 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment unit mated to an 8-speaker BOSE sound system. The display is nice and crisp and the font size is perfect.
You have this funky purple and pink colour scheme as standard. As is with most modern touchscreens, you can have a split display as well. You can also adjust the climate control settings and control the internal air circulation under various conditions. The system gets Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity, however, it is not wireless. Interestingly, the smaller 8-inch touchscreen on the lower variants gets wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.
By default, you get some soothing nature sounds in case you are bored of listening to advertisements on the radio. You can also choose different settings for the Bose sound system. The cluster theme can be selected through the touchscreen as well. The reversing camera quality is acceptable. The 360-degree camera feature is very usable while parking in tight spaces.
Lastly, you can toggle through various vehicle settings related to the driver assistance features (ADAS). If youre not sure what a particular option does, the description is right below. The head-up display settings are also included in the vehicle settings menu.
New on the Kia Seltos facelift is the dual-zone climate control. Good to see Kia retaining physical buttons and not opting for the touch-sensitive panels that we see on modern cars. The audio control buttons are placed below. Also, check out the new sleeker central AC vents.
Below, you have a wireless charger that interestingly gets a cooling function for your phone. Unfortunately, the wireless charger is tucked below the AC control panel, so you wont be able to see any notifications on your phone. Below you have a 12V power socket, a USB type A port and a USB type C port.
The gear lever setup has been carried forward along with the switches around it.
An electronic parking brake with auto hold function is a welcome addition to the facelift. This has freed up a lot of space here and you get a slot for keeping your phone below the EPB. Next to it, you get a cubbyhole with a sliding cover which also doubles up as a cupholder.
The centre armrest is wrapped in black leather which looks a bit odd in between the sage green coloured seats.
Panoramic sunroof lets in plenty of light and manages to make an all-black cabin feel airy.
All three passengers get individually adjustable headrests and 3-point seatbelts. Earlier Seltos had a lap belt for the middle passenger.
The seatback has a comfortable angle. The headroom is good. The thigh support is alright however, taller people might find the seat to be a little lower than expected though. Legroom is healthy and two 6-footers can sit one behind the other in reasonable comfort.
Like the previous car, the air purifier is placed inside the front centre armrest. You can now directly adjust its fan and display settings with the help of the buttons next to the display.
Below you have a small cubbyhole and two USB type C ports.
Rear grab handles now also get LED reading lamps.
The Seltos is equipped with UV-cut glass for the windshield as well as all the windows.
Boot space of the Seltos remains the same at 433 litres.
Spare on this X-Line trim is a 17-inch steel wheel shod with 215/60 section tyre.
The new and classy looking keyfob gets buttons on the side. You have the lock and unlock buttons at the top, followed by the remote start button and the tailgate unlock button.

Driving the Kia Seltos 1.5L Turbo-Petrol DCT Automatic
The 138 BHP, 1.4-litre Kappa turbo-petrol engine mated to the 7-speed DCT in the previous Seltos was quite powerful and quick. However, the engine had to be upgraded to meet the emission norms. The result is this Smartstream 1.5-litre turbo-petrol engine which still belongs to the Kappa family and makes an impressive 158 BHP and 253 Nm and is shared with the new Hyundai Verna. It has the highest numbers in its segment. The claimed 0-100 km/h time is 8.9 seconds, which means that the new Seltos 1.5 turbo petrol is quicker than the older 1.4 turbo petrol by 0.9 seconds.
Fire up the engine, and it's refined at idle, silently purring away. Hyundai-Kia powertrains have always set NVH benchmarks, and this car is no different. Shift to D or R, and it crawls away smoothly. Crawling at city speeds isn’t very dramatic and the 1.5L is very well-behaved. With light to medium throttle inputs, you can go about your daily commute quite comfortably. In comparison with the old 1.4L turbo-petrol, the throttle response is smoother and power delivery is more linear. The 7-speed dual-clutch transmission is also seamless moving through the initial gears. However, we did notice that the gearbox got a little confused on a few instances while driving through some traffic. The engine has a healthy bottom end and thanks to a turbocharger and direct injection, you’re never in a shortage of power. Just floor the accelerator if you want to close a gap in traffic or make that quick overtake and the engine and gearbox will do the rest.
Get on some open roads and you can let the Seltos stretch its legs. Put down your right foot and before you know it, you’ll hit the highway speed limit of 120 km/h. This is the thing with turbo-petrols - flooring the throttle on an empty stretch of road can get addictive. Outright acceleration is great and it feels a little more linear as well compared to say, the 1.5 TSI from the VW-Skoda cars. The turbo delivers a strong mid-range punch that will take care of all the overtaking on the highway. You can cruise along the highway at 100 km/h while the engine spins at a relaxed 1,800 rpm. Even at 120 km/h, the engine felt relaxed with the rev counter reading 2,200 rpm. The Seltos won't break a sweat cruising at these speeds all day long.
The dual-clutch transmission moves through the gears quite seamlessly. The kickdown response time is quick enough and the gearbox doesn’t hesitate to drop down 3 or even 4 gears at times to get the engine into the powerband. When you are in the mood for some fun in the ghats, switch to Sport mode and start flipping the paddle shifters for manual control. The ECU matches the revs and you’ll hear the sweet note of the engine. Yes, IMO, the engine sounds nice and sporty at high revs. Although Kia has restricted the maximum rpm to 5,900, which is too low, at least the engine sounds great as it reaches that number. The paddle shifters are responsive, and you can extract some performance from the engine using them for quick overtakes or keeping the engine in the powerband over some twisties. There is also an “S” mode which makes the transmission more aggressive. This mode can be engaged by moving the gear shifter to the right. However, the gearbox logic in the Taigun and Kushaq 1.5 DSG is better and more in tune with the requirements of the driver.

Drive Modes
The Seltos gets 3 drive modes - Eco, Normal and Sport.
Eco Mode - Engage the Eco mode when you want to extract maximum fuel efficiency. The throttle response is dulled, but given the power on tap, the mode is quite comfortable to use in the city. In fact, we preferred driving in this mode in the city as the car becomes a lot smoother to drive. The Auto Start-Stop feature is activated automatically when you select the Eco mode.
Normal Mode - This is the default mode and just as the name suggests, it's normal to drive. The difference between Normal and Eco modes is very little.
Sport Mode - Engage this mode when you want the car to be more responsive to your inputs. The throttle response is sharper, and the transmission also holds on to gears a bit longer in this mode. The steering is also noticeably heavier, although not as much as enthusiasts would like (more on this later). The Sport mode isn't something you'd want to engage in the city as it can get a bit jerky to drive.

Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH)
The 1.5-litre unit is very refined overall. At city speeds as well as while cruising at 100 km/h, you can barely hear the engine in the cabin. Even the vibrations are well controlled and cruising with the family on the highway should be comfortable. Kia claims that the dual pipe muffler design for the GT Line variants improves the exhaust noise. In comparison with the previous 1.4L turbo-petrol engine, the noise levels are lower by 1 decibel. Kia also claims that the front roll rod bush has been tuned to reduce high-speed booming.
Road noise from the tyres does creep into the cabin at highway speeds, but the wind noise is kept well in check. The engine has a sporty note to it at high revs.

Mileage & Fuel economy
The Seltos comes equipped with an Auto Start-Stop feature that helps fuel efficiency in city driving conditions. The ARAI-certified fuel efficiency for the 1.5-litre turbo-petrol DCT is 17.9 km/l and that for the 6-speed iMT is 17.7 km/l. Of course, the real-world FE numbers will be much lower considering that turbo-petrol DCTs are very sensitive to the driving style. We’ll wait for some ownership reviews to get a better picture of real-world fuel efficiency.
The 1.5 turbo petrol also features CVVD (Continuously Variable Valve Duration) which is claimed to not only achieve a boost in performance but also an improvement in fuel efficiency. In comparison, in engines with CVVT (Continuously Variable Valve Timing) or CVVL (Continuously Variable Valve Lift), the volume of air admitted is controlled by adjusting the depth of the opening. The duration cannot be controlled here. CVVD regulates the duration of valve opening and closing according to different driving conditions. For instance, when the vehicle is maintaining a constant speed and requires low engine output, CVVD holds open the intake valve until the middle of the compression stroke and from that point holds it closed until near the end of the compression stroke. This helps to improve fuel efficiency by reducing the resistance caused by compression.
1.5L, 4-cylinder turbo-petrol engine makes 158 BHP @ 5,500 rpm and 253 Nm @ 1,500-3,500 rpm.
The turbocharger sits at the back and the 1.5 also features low-pressure exhaust gas recirculation to reduce pumping losses.
Fuel tank capacity remains the same at 50 litres and the new Seltos is E20 compatible.

Suspension & Ride Comfort
This is an area that was concerning for most people in the earlier Seltos. The ride quality was noticeably firm which was a deal breaker for many. However, in the 2023 facelift, Kia has increased the dampening force which has softened up the ride. There’s still an underlying stiffness to the ride quality, but overall the setup is very similar to what you would find in a Creta. It’s much more liveable now and most owners would appreciate this change even on the 18-inch wheels. At slow speeds, the ride isn’t bone-jarring and small bumps and potholes are absorbed comfortably. The suspension works silently in absorbing small bumps and potholes. There’s still some amount of body roll felt inside the cabin over bad roads, but it’s manageable.
The Seltos gets a McPherson strut suspension at the front and a torsion beam axle at the rear. The GTX+ and X-Line variants come equipped with 18-inch alloy wheels shod with 215/55 section tyres. HTX and HTX+ variants get 17-inch wheels shod with 215/60 section tyres. The lower variants (HTE, HTK, HTK+) get 16-inch wheels with 205/65 section tyres.

Handling & Dynamics
Kia may have softened the suspension by a bit, but the Seltos still has an inherently mature suspension setup. It means that the Seltos behaves nicely at high speed. There is no bounciness or that feeling of floatiness. The car is well-planted with satisfactory high-speed stability. While doing triple-digit speeds on the open road, the Seltos displayed good composure. Recovery from expressway undulations is also surprisingly good for a Korean car.
In the area of dynamics, the Seltos is a clean & predictable handler. Through fast corners, the car remains sorted and there are no unnerving surprises. Of course, due to its height, some body roll is present, but it is well-controlled and one can push it through corners confidently. The difference between the previous setup and this one is little and you will notice only when you’re on the limit. Good to know that all variants
are equipped with ESP which can be a lifesaver in emergencies. Our test car was shod with JK UX Royale tyres whose grip levels were average. BHPians looking to extract some performance might want to upgrade to richer Michelin or Yokohama rubber.

Steering
The Seltos gets a well-tuned EPS steering. It is light & smooth in the city. As the speedometer climbs, the EPS feels reasonably direct and fast too. The fair all-round visibility, smooth gearboxes (automatics in particular) and light controls make this crossover easy to drive in urban conditions. On the highway, the steering feels stable and has no nervousness.

Braking
Kia has made all-wheel disc brakes standard across all variants. Additionally, you also get brake assist and ABS. While braking from high speeds, the car stops in a straight line without any drama. No complaints in the braking area. The brake pedal felt extremely sharp to the inputs and you have to be very gentle with the application to decelerate smoothly.

Niggles & Problems
The standard warranty of the Seltos is 3 years for unlimited km which can be extended up to the 5th year. Sadly, Kia doesn’t offer an extended warranty of up to 7 years like Hyundai.
While most of the recent feedback about this 1.5-litre turbo-petrol has been positive, the turbo-petrol engine with the dual-clutch transmission is something you should be careful with. Early owners of the Creta & Seltos 1.4 turbo-petrol DCT did face some gearbox overheating issues. While most of them have been resolved, it’s very much advisable to go for the maximum extended warranty. Don’t even think about it twice, it’s better to be safe than sorry.
