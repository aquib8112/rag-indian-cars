Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 4Matic+ Coupe Cons
An on-road price tag of over 2 crore makes it very pricey
Rear seats are not as comfortable as the regular GLE; headroom is compromised due to the coupe shape
Suspension has a firm edge to it. With the 21-inch wheels, the ride is stiff, though not uncomfortable
Missing features like electrically adjustable rear seats, comfort headrests for rear passengers, rear sunshade, and full-size spare tyre (has a space saver tyre)
As expected, it guzzles fuel, even if you drive it easy...and especially when you drive it hard

Introduction
The whole concept of a coupe SUV is frowned upon by many people. A lot of these cars get enough hate on the internet, but they are also something that a lot of people have warmed up to. In fact, in the Indian context, we’ll be looking at some coupe SUVs in the budget segment  very soon.
But today, we’re not here to talk about the budget segment. The car that we will discuss here is the Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 4MATIC+ Coupé (quite a mouthful). It is a coupe SUV with a 3-litre inline 6-cylinder engine that makes 429 BHP and 560 Nm. With the 4MATIC+ system, power is sent to all 4 wheels and that propels this 2.3-tonne car to 100 km/h from a standstill in just 5 seconds (claimed). That is quick!
The GLE Coupe was available with a V8 engine (AMG 63 S) in 2021 (Review Link). However, with the 2024 facelift, Mercedes has decided to offer only the inline 6-cylinder engine (AMG 53) in the car. And while this may not be as special as the "One man, One engine" V8, it's still a powerful motor and quite a lot of fun on the roads.

Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Price & Brochure
The Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Coupe is a full-size luxury SUV that also packs a serious punch. It competes against the likes of the Audi Q8 and the Porsche Cayenne Coupe but is more expensive and more powerful than both of them. The Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Coupe has an ex-showroom price of Rs. 1.85 crore.

Exterior
Front end gets AMG-specific bits to differentiate it from the regular GLE. You have the AMG grille and AMG bumper as well. The front end looks smart and has a mean vibe.
If you ignore the size, the rear looks very hatchback-like. Sloping roofline and the tailgate spoiler give the car a sporty look.
The very definition of a coupe SUV. The bonnet is high and the roofline slopes sharply towards the rear. Below the shoulder line, the car looks very much like a big and burly SUV while above the shoulder line, it looks sleek and almost sedan-like. Looks may be subjective, but in person, it does look quite handsome.
The GLE 53 AMG measures 4,944 mm in length, 2,157 mm in width and 1,716 mm in height with a wheelbase of 2,935 mm.
IMO, this is one of the best angles to view the GLE 53 AMG, especially in this Sodalite Blue paint shade. Sloping roofline makes the car look as if it's ready to pounce.
Multibeam LED headlamps come with a 4-point DRL design. AMG grille houses a big three-pointed star logo in the middle and a small AMG badge on the side. Below, you have a blacked-out skid plate.
While the regular GLE gets a Mercedes badge on the bonnet, the AMG carries the AMG Affalterbach crest.
While these 21-inch wheels look nice, an all-black design is available as an option, which would look much better on this car. Front tyres are 275/45 ZR21 units.
You must be familiar with the V8 BITURBO badge on the 63 AMGs, but since this is a 53 AMG, you get an inline 6-cylinder engine with a twin-scroll turbo and this simple Turbo badge on the fender.
Meatier 315/40 ZR21 tyres at the rear.
Sloping roofline extends into a lip spoiler. Also note that you get illuminated running boards on the side.
Sleek tail-lamps, very much like the smaller GLC.
Lip spoiler is subtle.
Down below you get a diffuser and AMG Performance exhaust system. The exhaust note is one of the most enjoyable bits about driving this AMG 53.

Interior
On the inside, there is a macchiato beige black theme which gives the car a sophisticated look. Quality of materials is excellent and everything you touch feels top class.
As someone whod be spending some time in the drivers seat of this car, this is a pleasant sight. The AMG flat-bottom steering wheel has nappa leather and non-slip microfiber finish and sensor surfaces on the horizontal spokes for different functions.
These are the two AMG buttons that enthusiasts will enjoy the most. The round display on the left has two buttons on the side which can be programmed for different functions on the car. Here its for engaging the performance exhaust and the auto start-stop function. The dial on the right is a rotary dial with the middle portion displaying the current driving mode. Engaging Sport+ mode automatically activates the performance exhaust.
Bright and clear digital instrument cluster is a pleasure to look at and displays all the relevant information.
You can pick and choose the different kinds of displays that you want. There are 2 AMG specific displays included.
You can also choose the kind of display for the head-up display.
Driver footwell is spacious. You get sporty metal pedals.
You get a 12.3-inch display that has wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration. The infotainment system is mated to a 13 speakers, 590 watts Burmester sound system. Different car-related information can be viewed on the screen as you can see below. You can even adjust the height of the air suspension from the touchscreen.
Different drive modes can be selected from the touchscreen and individual aspects also can be chosen. As mentioned earlier, the left dial on the steering wheel can be configured as per your liking. Like most of the modern Mercedes cars, you have an off-road mode here as well with a transparent bonnet option.
Four small central A/C vents are placed below the touchscreen. Physical controls for the AC are placed below and these feel wonderful to operate.
Below, theres a sliding cover that opens to reveal a couple of temperature-controlled cupholders. Theres a wireless charging pad as well along with 2 USB-C charging ports.
While you do have a touchscreen, you also get the conventional Mercedes touchpad. There are buttons for multiple functions around the touchpad. On the left, you have buttons for vehicle-related functions, while the ones on the right are for infotainment-related functions.
Switch for adjusting the ride height is placed further behind.
Black and beige leather seats look good and offer very good support. Theyre just perfect in terms of side support which makes you feel one with the car. Cushioning is a bit on the firmer side, but doesnt feel uncomfortable even after spending hours in the seats.
Front seats are heated and ventilated. The driver can also adjust the heating and ventilation of the front passenger seat by pressing the L button.
As expected in a coupe, rearward visibility is horrible. Best to rely on the 360-degree camera feature.
A closer look at the high-gloss brown linestructure lime wood trim of the dashboard. Note the ambient light strip below.
Sunroof is big and lets in plenty of light.
Legroom at the back is healthy and the backrest is also set at a comfortable angle. Headroom is adequate despite the sunroof and the sloping roofline. While it is a comfortable place to be in, compared to the regular GLE, this rear seat doesnt feel special. It misses out on electronically adjustable rear seats and even the centre armrest is pretty basic.
You get dual-zone climate control at the rear as well. Rear A/C controls get nice physical buttons and a basic display.
The boot space is, of course, lesser than the regular GLE thanks to the sloping roof. Still, at 655 litres, it is more than enough for a familys weekend luggage.

Driving the 3.0L Turbo Petrol AT
The 3.0L, inline 6-cylinder turbo petrol engine makes 429 BHP @ 5,800-6,100 rpm and 560 Nm @ 2,200 - 5,000 rpm. It is mated to a 9-speed torque converter AT.
Driving an AMG is always special, and this GLE 53 AMG is no different. While it doesnt have the howling V8 engine from the 63 S, it still makes 429 BHP and 560 Nm from the 3.0L, inline 6-cylinder turbo-petrol unit which is more than enough for Indian roads. The engine gets a 48V onboard electrical system with an integrated starter generator which provides additional power and torque at low speeds and low rpms. It is mated to a 9-speed AMG Speedshift TCT 9G torque converter AT.
With your foot on the brake pedal, press the engine start stop button and the engine comes to life and purrs silently. Nothing exciting about startup. If you want something special on startup, keep one of the paddles pulled and then press the start-stop button. What youll be doing is activating the AMG Emotion Start in which the engine revs while starting and you get a nice growl from the exhaust. You will never get tired of starting the car this way, as it will leave people wondering if you have some modified car.
Start driving with a light foot in Comfort mode and you will notice how easy and smooth the car feels to drive. The throttle response is good. You get a smooth and linear power delivery and the GLE doesnt feel like its going to jump with the slightest of throttle inputs. At slow speeds and while driving around in the city, it is best if you stick to the Comfort mode as the car feels just right. Theres enough low-end power for you to make those overtakes and close the gap to the vehicle in front quickly. Even the gearshifts are smooth and the gearbox can quickly upshift to higher gears when needed. All in all, with a commanding driving position and easy controls, the GLE 53 is comfortable to drive around in the city. Only in some areas, you might have to be careful because of the size of the car (almost 5 m), but otherwise, you wont have any trouble manoeuvring this coupe SUV around town.
Flex your right foot and thats when you get to know the real potential of this engine. The way this big SUV moves will shock you. Put your foot hard down and you will find yourself pinned to the seat. I tried a couple of hard acceleration runs from a standstill and I can tell you that the claimed 0-100 km/h time of 5 seconds is believable. The 4Matic+ all-wheel drive system with fully variable torque distribution efficiently distributes the power to the four wheels for maximum traction. Theres barely any wheel spin at launch and the car just blasts off the line. The engine revs till the redline and upshifts are super quick. The car just keeps pulling till you back off the throttle. Hearing the engine and the exhaust at high revs surely does get addictive. Downshifts on the highway for overtakes are extremely quick and while cruising, you barely will have to use 50% throttle.
The GLE 53 AMG comes with an AMG Performance variable exhaust system that alters the exhaust note based on the drive mode selected. The exhaust note isnt as loud as the V8, but its still good and something enthusiasts will enjoy. It has all the pops and bangs on lift off and while it sounds great on the outside, you dont hear it as much on the inside.
The GLE 53 AMG rides on 21-inch wheels as opposed to 22-inch wheels on the GLE 63 S. You also get air suspension with an adaptive damping system which means that the car can automatically control the damping depending on driving speed, driving program and payload. In Comfort mode, the ride isnt very stiff and the car manages to tackle small potholes and bumps comfortably. You do hear the suspension working though. Over bad roads, the ride is wallowy and you do move around in the cabin. Its not unbearable though and very much liveable. As you get up to speed, the ride flattens out and the car feels a lot more stable and planted. High-speed stability is great and you or your passengers wont feel that youre cruising at 120 km/h.
Get on some twisty roads and you can have some fun. The handling is precise and predictable. The front end is responsive and the car feels planted in the corners. There is body roll, but its very well controlled. The way this car handles, you will forget that it weighs around 2.3 tonnes. Its just very nimble and balanced throughout. What helps is the Active Ride Control which has active anti-roll bars on the front and rear axles that counter body roll. With the AMG high-performance composite brake system, the braking is sharp and precise.
All in all, the GLE 53 AMG is an all-out fun-to-drive car. It has got the power and sorted handling characteristics as well. It even has all the bits that make an AMG car feel special.
The GLE 53 gets air suspension with adaptive damping.
Here's a look at the difference in ride height when in Sport+ mode (lower) vs Comfort mode (higher).
