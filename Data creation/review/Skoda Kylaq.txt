Skoda Kylaq Cons
Just one engine on offer. No diesel, no CNG, no electric, no 1.5L petrol like the Kushaq
Interior quality doesnt feel up to old-school Skoda standards
Mediocre 4 speaker + 2 tweeter sound system. Competition offers a better sound experience
Missing some features like the 360-degree view camera, subwoofer, driving modes, ADAS
Narrow width makes a 5th adult completely unwelcome. Best for 4 adults onboard
Skodas after-sales service can be a hit or miss. The brands long-term reliability can be patchy as well.

Introduction
Skoda is finally stepping into the highly contested sub-4m SUV segment with the Kylaq. This segment has seen a lot of action in the past years and in fact, even developed sub-segments within itself. But given the high volumes, Skoda aims to grab some market share here. Theyre betting big on the Kylaq and rightly so. Theyve managed to pack all the good things from the bigger Kushaq in a slightly smaller package. It has good features, has decent space and gets the smaller engine from the Kushaq as well. The bigger 1.5L TSI petrol is still exclusive for the Kushaq and Slavia. So while the Kylaq has all the things going its way, will it be able to take the fight to the well-established rivals like the Maruti Brezza, Tata Nexon, Hyundai Venue and Kia Sonet? Is this the right time to enter this segment? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, we spent a day with the Kylaq in Goa, so lets get into all the details.

Skoda Kylaq Price & Brochure
The Kylaq is offered with only one engine option, which is the 3-cylinder, 1.0-litre turbo-petrol motor that makes 114 BHP and 178 Nm of torque. This is a big disadvantage for Skoda, as the other cars in this competition offer either a diesel or a CNG and in the case of the Nexon, even an electric powertrain.
There are 4 variants  Classic, Signature, Signature + and Prestige. The starting price for the manual variant is Rs. 7.89 lakh and goes up to Rs. 14.40 lakh (ex-showroom) for the top-end Prestige variant. Looking at the competition, you can say that the pricing is on par with the competition. This is a price-sensitive segment and all of the cars fall in this Rs. 10  17 lakh (on-road) price bracket.

Exterior
Design & Styling
Weve established by now that the Kylaq is a smaller version of the Kushaq. Even when it comes to styling, theyre pretty similar. You will find the sharp lines and design elements on the Kylaq as well which in fact makes both cars look pretty similar. The Kylaq gets the new Skoda grille in black without any chrome. The LED DRLs are placed next to the grille and the headlamps are placed on the bumper. The rear is where the design of tail lamps differentiates the Kylaq and the Kushaq distinctively.
The Kylaq measures 3,995 mm in length, 1,783 mm in width, and 1,619 mm in height and has a wheelbase of 2,566 mm. For a sub-4m car, the Kylaq has a good road presence. When you compare the dimensions of the Kylaq and the Kushaq, youll notice that the Kylaq is taller by 7 mm and has the same width as the Kushaq (1,975 mm with mirrors). Placed next to each other, they seem the same size to a laymans eyes. In terms of equipment, the top-end gets LED projector headlamps, LED DRLs, 17-inch wheels and LED tail lamps. Its available in a total of 7 colours  Olive Gold (Our test car), Lava Blue, Deep Black, Tornado Red, Candy White, Carbon Steel and Brilliant Silver.

Build Quality, Fit & Finish
The Kylaq shares its platform with the Kushaq and Slavia. Its a modular platform that has been adapted for India and the overall fit and finish is good. The doors have a certain amount of heft to them and theres not much flex in the body panels as well. That being said, if youve been in some of the older cars from Skoda like the Rapid or Fabia, you will feel that the Kylaq is missing the sturdiness. Its still a well-built and solid car.

Wheels & Tyres
The lower variants get the 16-inch wheels while the top-end prestige variant gets 17-inch alloy wheels. Theyre shod with 205/55 R17 tyres and the recommended tyre pressure is 33 psi on all 4 wheels. If youre travelling with load (5 people and luggage), its 41 psi at the front and 48 psi at the rear. The spare wheel is a 15-inch steel wheel with a 195/65 section tyre.

Ground Clearance
The Kylaq has an unladen ground clearance of 189 mm which is healthy enough for Indian roads. We didnt scrape the car anywhere.

Standard & Extended Warranty
The Kylaq comes with a standard warranty of 3 years / 1,00,000 km. You can extend the warranty up to 6 years / 1,50,000 km and we highly recommend that you do so. The prices for the extended warranty package are not yet revealed, but the Kushaq and Slavia are in the range of Rs. 21,000 so we can expect it to be slightly less than that. Like other Skoda cars, you also get a 6-year anti-corrosion warranty.

Maintenance
Skoda is offering a complimentary 3-year standard maintenance package for the first 33,333 customers. The Kushaq and Slavia have a service interval of 15,000 km and we can expect the Kylaq to have the same as well. Skoda also has a
service cost calculator on their website
which gives a good estimate of what to expect. The details for the Kylaq will be updated soon.

Safety
The highlight of the Kylaq is of course the 5-star BNCAP safety rating. Apart from that, the car comes with 6 airbags as standard, ESC, traction control, EBD, electronic differential lock, rollover protection, brake disc wiping, passive TPMS, hill hold control and ISOFIX child seat anchors.

Interior
Cabin Design & Quality
Step inside the cabin and you can see a dual-tone dashboard, which again seems to draw inspiration from the elder Kushaq. There are some interesting details here like the dashboard uses a sustainable bamboo-fibre-infused material. Then you also have touch-sensitive buttons for the climate control and some other options and bits of piano black and chrome at various places. Overall, the design is pretty simple and straightforward, but has some modern bits. Its not a polarizing design and very much likeable. The quality of plastics used is good in various places, except for the AC vents, which feel a bit flimsy. They might break off easily. Otherwise, the plastics are good and not scratchy and most of the other parts feel sturdy.

Space & Comfort
Skoda has managed to keep the interior dimensions pretty much the same as the Kushaq. The cabin width and overall space are as much as the Kushaq which is great for the Kylaq. Its still best for 4 adults to travel comfortably, as the 5th adult would be a tight fit. The cabin is tall and despite the sunroof, the headroom is not an issue at the front or back.
The front seats offer good support. Theyre quite comfy as well and have decent side bolstering too. You get leather upholstery on the top-end variant and fabric seats on all the other variants. The leatherette is of acceptable quality but does make the cabin feel upmarket.

Driving Position & Ergonomics
Both front seats get 6-way power adjustment which is great. The steering wheel is also adjustable for rake and reach. So, finding your perfect driving position is quite easy. The steering is nice to hold and overall frontal visibility is good. In terms of ergonomics, everything falls into place pretty easily and you will not have any issues whatsoever.

Cabin Storage
Theres a good amount of storage for the front passengers. All doorpads can hold a 1-litre bottle and some other stuff. The glovebox is decently sized and also has a removable sunglass holder. You get cupholders and some additional storage under the driver armrest as well. Theres a recess on the dashboard to keep some stuff. The front seatbacks have deep pockets as well as smartphone holders for rear passengers to use. Like most Skoda cars, there is a ticket / FASTag clip on the windshield as well.

Air-Conditioning
We drove the car in Goa on a particularly hot day when the temperatures rose up to 36 degrees Celsius. The air conditioning unit managed to keep the cabin cool throughout. The 1.0 TSI owners had raised concerns regarding the A/C cooling and Skoda claims to have sorted that out. We didnt face any issues during our test drive. The front passengers also get ventilated seats which is a great feature to have. However, the only gripe about this is that the fan is too loud and very much audible in the cabin.

Features
Unique & Noteworthy Features
Given the competitive space that the Kylaq is competing in, Skoda has made sure to equip it with all the features. You get ventilated front seats with 6-way electric adjustment, automatic headlamps, automatic wipers, auto-dimming IRVM, a 10-inch infotainment touchscreen unit with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, wireless phone charger, rear AC vents, ambient lighting and a sunroof. You do miss out on the 360-degree view camera and ADAS.

Audio System & Sound Quality
The Signature+ and Prestige variants come with a 10-inch infotainment touchscreen and you get 4 speakers and 2 tweeters. The system is just above average and not something that would excite audiophiles. The sound quality is good, but nothing more than that.

Rear Passengers
Rear Seat Comfort & Space
Jumping into the rear seat, the ingress and egress are easy given the height of the car. Given the shorter wheelbase of the Kylaq, the legroom for rear passengers is comparatively less than the Kushaq. Suhaas307 (6 1 tall) had just about enough legroom behind his driving position. I (510) had a couple of inches worth of legroom when I sat behind my driving position. Theres a good amount of headroom on offer and the seat width is good for two adults and a kid. The seats are similar to the ones on the Kushaq and they offer good underthigh support. The cushioning is perfect  neither too soft nor too firm. All 3 seats get adjustable headrests. Rear occupants get a/c vents and a couple of Type-C USB ports for their smartphones.

Boot Space
Theres been some confusion these days as to the measurement of boot space. On the Kylaq, if you measure the boot space up to the parcel tray, you have 360 litres. If you measure it to the roof (without the parcel tray), then you get 446 litres of boot space. You can further increase the boot space to 1,265 litres by folding down the rear seats. The loading lip is high though, and you will have to lift your bags to take them out. The boot gets a light, parcel tray and bag hooks. You even get a smart space to store the parcel tray. Practically, it is a spacious boot and good enough for a small familys weekend getaway.

Driving the Skoda Kylaq 1.0L Turbo Petrol AT
The only engine option on the Kylaq is the 999cc, turbocharged, 3-cylinder, direct-injection petrol engine that puts out 114 BHP and 178 Nm. This engine is paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed torque converter automatic (AQ250-6F). It is shared with the Kushaq, Slavia, Taigun and the Virtus. The Kylaq doesn’t get the bigger 1.5-litre turbo-petrol engine that these cars get. Being the only engine option on offer puts the Kylaq at a bit of a disadvantage compared to some of the other cars in the segment. Cars like the Tata Nexon, Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet and the Mahindra XUV3XO also have a diesel engine on offer. The Maruti Brezza and Tata Nexon also come with a factory-fitted CNG option.
The engine is pretty refined at idle and you don’t get the typical 3-cylinder hum from the engine. Start driving and you’ll notice that the throttle response is satisfactory and the Kylaq moves off the line with ease. The engine is tractable and isn't dead at low rpms. But, there is little turbo lag. If you want, you can pull from under 1,000 rpm, but it's only when you cross 1,500 rpm that the motor starts feeling more comfortable. The turbo kicks in at ~2,000 rpm and if you're used to a strong turbo kick, you will be slightly disappointed by the soft power delivery of this unit. Even in bumper-to-bumper traffic, the Kylaq feels smooth. However, since the Kylaq has a manual handbrake, you don’t get an auto-hold function, which is dearly missed when stuck in traffic. Overall, the city driveability is good and the power delivery is nice and linear. Combined with light electric power steering, good ergonomics and excellent all-round visibility, the Kylaq is very city-friendly.
Out on the highway is where you will appreciate the mid-range and the top-end of the engine. Past the 2,000 rpm mark, the engine pulls nice and clean all the way to 5,500. If you're pushing hard, this is where you would want to be. A bonus here is that the engine doesn't sound coarse at high revs, in fact, it sounds quite sporty. Even beyond 5,500 rpm, the top-end isn't flat and the engine keeps pulling all the way to 6,600 rpm. Highway cruising is a comfortable affair too in the Kylaq and it can do triple-digit speeds quite easily. You will see the engine rpm settled at ~1,900 rpm at 100 km/h and ~2,400 at 120 km/h. All in all, the engine is fast enough for Indian roads.
The 6-speed torque converter is butter-smooth in its operation and you will barely notice the shifts happening. Also in day-to-day driving conditions, the torque converter automatic makes sure you are in the right gear almost all the time. We didn't find it getting confused or hunting for gears at any point and the AT will keep most drivers happy. There’s an ‘S’ mode as well, which holds on to the gears a bit longer than the ‘D’ mode and is slightly more aggressive with the shifts. The claimed 0-100 km/h acceleration time for this automatic gearbox is 11.5 seconds. You also get a manual mode and there are paddle shifters if you want full control, but like most torque converters, these aren't very engaging. Most owners will just let the electronics do all the shifting.
Driving the Skoda Kylaq 1.0L Turbo Petrol 6MT
The 1.0 TSI engine is also offered with a 6-speed manual transmission (MQ200-6F). This is also the gearbox that we have seen on the other cars based on the MQB-IN platform. One of the first things you will notice when you depress the clutch is that the travel is long. It is not very heavy, but it’s not as light as some of the Maruti cars. It does feel a bit springy as well when releasing. Getting off the line is however not that difficult and you can move smoothly. It’s best if you don’t lug this engine as you might end up stalling. And in case you stall, all you need to do is press the clutch pedal all the way in and the engine fires back up. This is essentially an extension of the engine auto start/stop feature.
The gearbox has short throws and the gates are well defined. Moving through gears is not as smooth as say in the Maruti Brezza, but it’s fairly convenient. Quick shifts while driving enthusiastically are handled well. The gear ratios are spread out nicely and you can putter around town in the first 3 gears comfortably. The maximum speed you can do in the 1st gear is 50 km/h and you can go up to 95 km/h in the 2nd gear.
Highway cruising is a comfortable affair too in the Kylaq and it can do triple-digit speeds quite easily. The 6 gear ratios will help you extract maximum fuel efficiency from this motor. It revs at a comfortable ~2,100 rpm at 100 km/h and 2,500 rpm at 120 km/h in 6th gear. For a quick overtake, however, from cruising speeds, you might have to downshift to 4th to get the engine in its powerband. Skoda claims a 0-100 km/h acceleration time of 10.5 seconds with this manual transmission.

Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH)
The 1.0L TSI is overall a refined motor. Despite being a 3-cylinder engine, the vibrations and noise are well controlled. On the move, things are fine at regular rpms. It's only when you hit high revs that the 3-cylinder thrum is obvious. But it’s an enjoyable, sporty note. Road and tyre noise are also kept in check. On the other hand, wind noise did start creeping in at 90 km/h, but it was not excessive.

Mileage & Fuel economy
If driven with a light foot, the 1.0 TSI should give you an acceptable FE. However, do keep in mind that turbo-petrol cars are sensitive to throttle input and the torque converter automatic does sips in more fuel than a manual. So, drive the car hard and you'll see the tank needle drop very fast. To aid fuel efficiency, you get an idle start/stop system that shuts off the engine when the car is stationary and the gear position is neutral.
Claimed fuel efficiency –
1.0 TSI MT – 19.68 km/l
1.0 TSI AT – 19.05 km/l
1.0L turbo-petrol engine makes 114 BHP @ 5,000-5,500 rpm and 178 Nm @ 1,750-4,000 rpm.
No insulation sheet under the bonnet.
Fuel tank capacity is 45 litres.

Suspension & Ride Comfort
Back in October last year, I got the chance to drive the pre-production version of the Kylaq
at the CoASTT High Performance Centre in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu and I was quite impressed with the ride and handling of the car. I was also looking forward to driving it on regular roads to get a hang of how it would be to live with the Kylaq. Overall, not a lot has changed from the pre-production version to the production version. The Kylaq comes with a McPherson strut suspension at the front and a twist-beam rear axle. The ride quality is very similar to the Kushaq which just hits the right spot. It’s neither too soft nor too stiff. Owners used to driving some of the older German cars will appreciate this suspension tune. It has an underlying stiffness to it, which is why you feel the potholes in the cabin at low speeds. It’s not uncomfortable though. The 17-inch wheels further add to the stiffness of the suspension. We expect the 16-inch rims to do better in this area.

Handling & Dynamics
Get up to highway speeds and the ride quality gets better. The Kylaq has sorted road manners and maintains composure at high speeds. Expansion joints or road undulations at highway speeds are handled nicely and don’t unsettle the car very easily.
I was impressed with the Kylaq when pushing it hard on the track and it is impressive on the regular roads as well. The wide front and rear track accompanied by short overhangs means that the Kylaq has a wide footprint. This makes the chassis more stable and gives it more grip around corners. Sure, there is some body roll due to the height of the car, but nothing alarming though. The turn-in is sharp and it’s easy to place the car in the corners. Quick direction changes are also handled really well.

Steering
The EPS feels direct & sharp. It is light at parking & city speeds which is now the market's preference. It is still a level too light and comfort-oriented at high speeds and we wish Skoda had firmed things up a bit. Even when pushing the car hard in corners, you will wish for more weight along with the directness. It still feels a bit vague in the center. For day-to-day driving, however, it does the job pretty well.

Braking
The Kylaq gets disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear which is more like a segment standard. The brakes perform well and are adequate for the performance on offer. Emergency braking maneuvers are also handled well and the car comes to a halt without much drama. The brake pedal is well-calibrated and feels sharp to use.

Skoda Kylaq Exterior Images
Carrying the Skoda DNA, the Kylaq is a good-looking vehicle. The front gets the new Skoda grille with LED DRLs on the sides. The headlamps are placed below and you get a wide air dam at the bottom. It looks wide and has a good road presence.
The rear is where some people arent very happy with the styling. The taillamps are a size too small and the plastic strip on the tailgate looks a bit odd.
In the side profile, you can see that the rear overhang is pretty short. Prominent body lines give the car a muscular look.
The Kylaq measures 3,995 mm in length, 1,783 mm in width, and 1,619 mm in height. It has a wheelbase of 2,566 mm and an unladen ground clearance of 189 mm. It is almost the same size as the Kushaq, except for the sub-4 m length.
Overall build quality and the fit and finish are good. There are a total of 7 colours  Olive Gold (Our test car), Lava Blue, Deep Black, Tornado Red, Candy White, Carbon Steel and Brilliant Silver.
The LED DRLs are placed at the top. The headlamp pod consists of an LED projector light on the outside and an LED fog lamp on the inside that also doubles up as a cornering lamp.
The Kylaq gets the new Skoda grille finished in gloss black.
The air dam below is pretty wide and you also get a faux skid plate.
The underbody is exposed and you get no protection as such.
Bonnet gets prominent creases that give it a muscular look.
Turn indicators are integrated into the ORVMs. No 360-degree camera though.
Door handles get a chrome strip and request sensor.
Theres a trend of overdoing the plastic cladding around the wheels to give it a more SUV look. Thankfully, you get minimal cladding here. 17-inch alloy wheels are shod with 205/55R17 section tyres.
Rear wheels get drum brakes. The Goodyear Assurance tyres provide decent grip.
You get a sunroof and a shark fin antenna. The roof rails are purely for aesthetic purposes.
A look at the small LED tail lamps.
The black plastic connecting the taillamps looks odd. As is the case with the new Skoda cars, you get the SKODA lettering instead of the badge at the rear.
Rear bumper gets a faux skid plate and small reflectors.
The exhaust is neatly tucked away and not visible from the rear.

Skoda Kylaq Interior Images
Interiors of the Kylaq are similar to the Kushaq in many aspects, but some bits help differentiate the two cars.
The two-spoke steering wheel from the recent Skoda cars makes its way to the Kylaq as well. It has tilt and telescopic adjustment and feels great to hold.
LHS buttons are for audio & voice commands, while the ones on the RHS are for the MID. Scrollers have a knurled finish. Since the Kylaq doesnt get any driver assistance features, the top button on the RHS is a dummy.
Automatic variant gets paddle shifters. As expected from a torque converter, the shifts arent very engaging.
8" digital cockpit displays plenty of information. The instrument cluster gets digital temperature and fuel gauges and shows the time, outside temperature and distance to empty.
Skoda's virtual cockpit has multiple display options that can be selected by using the steering buttons. You can select what information you want to be displayed primarily like the speedometer or the tachometer or you can even have a minimalist display of just the speed in km/h. You can also choose to have the driving statistics displayed in between the tachometer/speedometer.
One of Skodas Simply Clever bits - a ticket / FASTag clip on the windshield.
Big Octagonal side A/C vents.
Typical European headlamp and foglamp controls. The Kylaq gets automatic headlamps.
The engine start / stop button has been placed on the side of the steering column.
The doorpad has a black-and-white theme. The front door pockets can carry a 1-litre bottle and some other stuff.
The usual set of window and mirror controls that weve seen on other Skoda cars. Driver's window gets auto up & down with an anti-pinch function.
Interesting design element near the armrest which uses a recycled plastic insert. While the thought is nice, the finish on this panel couldve been better. The edges felt rough.
Black leatherette seats offer good overall support. Both front seats have 6-way power adjustment and are ventilated as well.
A look at the footwell of the automatic variant. The pedals are well-spaced, but I wish the dead pedal wouldve been wider.
Heres the footwell of the manual variant. The clutch has long travel.
The auto-dimming IRVM barely manages to cover the rear windshield. Also, if there are rear passengers, the view is hampered.
The rearward view from the drivers seat isnt that great thanks to the thick C-pillars and a small rear windshield. The headrests also block the view.
Typical Skoda ORVM. Wed have liked it if it was a bit bigger. However, at least at this size, it doesnt cause a blind spot.
A recessed area on top of the dashboard to place some stuff.
The 10-inch touchscreen infotainment has wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The infotainment is mated to a 4 speaker and 2 tweeter system that sounds pretty average.
The system still feels pretty basic, but has some car-related settings and you can also quickly check vehicle stats and driving data. The reversing camera is very average quality and Skoda shouldve offered a 360-degree camera system.
All the A/C vents feel flimsy. This is a common Skoda-VW problem and wed have hoped that it be resolved by now. You get some basic functions below like the ventilated seats (only 2 levels), central locking and auto start / stop. Below you have the HVAC control panel with touch-sensitive controls. Theyre okay to use, but wed have preferred physical buttons instead.
You also get a wireless charging pad along with two USB type-C charging ports.
You get a manual handbrake and a non-slip base for the cupholder in the center console. The driver can open a bottle placed here with one hand.
The driver armrest gets a contrast white stitching and it can slide forward.
You get some storage underneath.
Just like the doorpad, the center console also gets this green recycled plastic insert.
The dashboard uses this environment-friendly material which Skoda calls a sustainable bamboo-fibre-infused pad. It looks quite nice though.
A decent-sized glovebox gets a removable sunglass holder. It is ventilated, but not illuminated.
Roof bezel holds two individual lights, sunroof controls and the Bluetooth mic.
You get a regular-sized sunroof that keeps the cabin bright and airy.
Rear seats are best for 2 adults to travel comfortably as a third adult would be a squeeze. All 3 passengers get adjustable headrests and 3-point seatbelts.
At 61, Suhaas307 had just about enough legroom behind his driving position. Headroom is plenty though. The backrest felt a bit upright and the under-thigh support is adequate.
Two Type-C USB charging ports are provided below the simple rear vents.
Both front seats have deep seatback pockets and - uniquely - smartphone pockets for rear passengers to use.
Rear light console consists of two individual LED lights. The roof liner is of decent quality, but there is noticeable flex when you operate these buttons. This makes it feel very budget grade.
The Kylaq has a boot space of 360 litres if measured till the parcel tray.
Another one of Skodas Simply Clever bits is that there is a recess to keep the parcel tray. This is indeed brilliant. Without the parcel tray, the boot space when measured up the roof is 446 litres.
You can fold down the middle row and the boot space goes up to 1,265 litres.
Spare wheel is a 15-inch steel rim with a 195/65 section tyre. The tools are placed neatly inside a Styrofoam casing.
You get a single boot light and a couple of baggage hooks.
