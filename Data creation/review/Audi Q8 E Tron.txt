Audi Q8 e-tron Cons
Not really a Q8. Based on the Q5 LWB mated to an EV drivetrain
Raised floor results in lack of under-thigh support, especially for taller passengers at the back
Interior quality is not at the same level as the Petrol Q8. Plastic trim quality below the waistline leaves a lot to be desired in this price segment
Will be expensive, just like other EVs from the luxury marques
Neither-here-nor-there design language of the Sportback can be polarizing

Introduction
There was a time, not too long ago when electric vehicles were simply not an option even for those interested in one. Other than a smattering of Revas, EVs were as good as non-existent. ICE-Hybrid cars too were few in number.
However, one look at the roads today would be enough to deduce that the EV Revolution has not only just begun, but is well and truly underway! There is something for everyone, right from the entry-level offerings by Tata and MG that cost around Rs. 10 lakh, to the top-of-the-line Taycan by Porsche, and everything else in between! Hyundai and Kia are making waves in the entry-level luxury EV space, and Mercedes started the movement a couple of years ago with the introduction of the EQC. Audi joined the party in 2021 with the e-tron 50 and e-tron 55 SUV and Sportback. BMW has recently entered the space in a big way with the iX and the i7, but now, Audi appears to have moved the goalpost with the introduction of the Q8 e-tron SUV and Sportback.
Let’s get one thing out of the way - the Q8 e-tron SUV does not have the footprint of the ICE-powered Q8. This is because the Q8 e-tron is not a Q8 with an electric drivetrain, contrary to what you may assume when you catch a glimpse of the Q8 badge. It’s actually based on the Q5 platform rather than the Q8's. The Q8 e-tron is essentially the facelifted version of the e-tron 50 and 55 that Audi introduced a couple of years ago.

Exterior
Design & Styling
While Mercedes and BMW have introduced electric cars with over-the-top styling, Audi seems to have stuck to their trusty understated design language that has evolved over the years ever-so-slightly.
Normally, electric car variants from most manufacturers carry distinctive electric car styling with overused blue-green elements  an attempt to denote the green-ness of the vehicle. And then you have plugged or, in the case of Tesla, non-existent front grilles. Audi has clearly played it safe by not deviating too much from its established design language. The large and wide grille has become something of an Audi trait over the years. Audi's focus this time around has been on making incremental improvements to the bodywork in order to make the new Q8 e-tron more slippery through the air. This is reflected in the improved drag-coefficient values of the new car and consequently, the improved range.

Q8 e-tron SUV.
The SUVs conventional design speaks to us in a way that the Sportback simply doesnt. As mentioned previously, the Q8 e-tron SUV does not have the footprint of the ICE-powered Q8, because its actually a Q5 underneath.
That aside, the Q8 e-tron is a handsome car in SUV body style particularly. The overall proportions are just right. With the air suspension adjusted to its lowest setting, the car looks hunkered down and ready to attack. It could almost pass off as an Audi estate / station-wagon a.k.a Avant thanks to its extended rear quarter glass and SUV styling. When raised to its maximum setting, it looks as thoroughbred as any SUV worth its salt should. The chunky 20-inch wheels fill the arches perfectly and lend it the stance that it deserves. Its a fuss-free and straight-forward design that should age gracefully as the years go by. However, the same may not be said about its Sportback sibling.
Audi's trademark hexagonal grille now with a little mascara and eye-shadow.
Typical Audi styling - clean and straightforward. Tail-lights are connected by a light strip that runs across the width of the tailgate. Gloss black faux diffuser is a new addition.
Fuss-free side profile with a dash of gloss black to break the monotony.
Sharp front three-quarter view - looks ready to trim a beard.
Chunky 20-inch wheels fill the arches perfectly.
Sharp styling for the headlights and DRLs as well.
Audi's Digital Matrix Technology apparently consists of 1.3 million micro-processors and 5 dynamic high-resolution projectors. Sadly, we did not get to see them do their little dance which Audi calls the 'Extended light staging function'.
Nothing to suggest that it's an EV, except maybe the expansive silver grille.
Audi took this opportunity to showcase its new 2D logo which now has its own lighting nestled underneath the seam of the grille.
Air ducts below the headlights, designed to ensure seamless and efficient airflow around the car.
Sleek ORVMs with smartly integrated repeaters. In other markets, the Q8 e-tron gets virtual mirrors, which are essentially cameras that relay the image on a small screen integrated into the upper portion of the doorpads. Audi has decided to skip this feature for the Indian market for obvious reasons.
Little camera under the ORVM does a great job of capturing the car straying from its lane.
Q8 e-tron logos on the B-Pillar, perhaps the only other indication that this car is an EV.
20-inch alloy wheels are designed to maximize aero-efficiency. Massive rotors and 6-pot calipers finished in red,

255/50 R20 Bridgestone Alenza tyres offer a great balance between grip and comfort.
Body-coloured cladding gives the Q8 e-tron a clean side profile. A touch of gloss black helps break the monotony.
Inspired by Porsche's Taycan and their own e-tron GT, the Q8 e-tron comes with two charging slots, nestled underneath a retractable panel between the front wheel arch and the front door. Push the button on the fender, and the panel folds downwards revealing a charging port.
AC charging at 11 kW / 22 kW will take 8.5 hours and 4.5 hours respectively for a full charge.
DC charging rated at a maximum of 170 kW will juice it up to 80% from 10% in just 30 minutes!

Red does suit the car provided it is also specified with the black pack for appropriate contrast.

Interior
The first thing we noticed while climbing into the Q8 e-tron was the high floor - a typical EV trait, thanks (of course) to the battery pack housed within the cars floor pan. Once you get comfortable in the front seats, you stop noticing the high floor and start noticing the number of screens and displays that adorn the dashboard  three of them to be exact. You will also notice splashes of brushed aluminium paired with luxurious leather that elevates the interior  an absolute necessity considering that the choice of plastics used below the waistline is highly questionable, especially given the price bracket we expect the car to be in. Some of the plastics are appalling, to say the least, and shouldnt be found in a Rs. 70 lakh car let alone an SUV expected to cost Rs. 1.5 crore! In fact, the overall quality of the plastic material used in the car establishes the fact that this isnt actually a Q8 but a Q5 with some nice bits here and there.
Once you bring yourself to look beyond the plastics, you will begin to enjoy the thoughtfulness with which the interior has been designed as well as the optional gadgets, provided you spec it correctly.
The instrument cluster behind the steering column is, predictably, digitized (Audis Virtual Cockpit), and the layout of the information on display can be configured in a number of ways. It also provides you with safety-related information using the hardware mounted on the ORVMs, such as lane-departure and blind-spot warnings.
Below the A/C vents is Audis 10.1-inch MMI head-unit. It offers a variety of options that allow you to control nearly every aspect of the car, right from driving modes via the Audi Drive Select to in-car entertainment (wired Apple CarPlay / Android Auto). It also allows you to control various options specified with the car, for example, the ventilated and massage seats, while seamlessly providing you with general information about the vehicle. The optional 360-degree camera along with park-assist can also be controlled via this screen.
Below the MMI head-unit, is an 8.6-inch capacitive screen with haptic feedback that allows you control over the cars 4-zone climate control system amongst other things.
The cabin is generally well-appointed, save for the sub-par plastics used in places. The leather-wrapped steering is a joy to hold and operate. The aircraft-style gear selector, with its leather-wrapped padding and brushed aluminium inlays, feels great to use. You would be forgiven for thinking that the entire requires to be moved to select gears, but all you need to do is gently thumb the aluminium portion of the selector to toggle between neutral, reverse and drive. The park button is integrated into the selector and appropriately marked P for convenience.
The cabin is also lined with a decent number of cubbies for storing knick-knacks and water bottles. The cubbies themselves are lined with a felt-like material, ensuring that rattling due to loose objects are kept to a minimum.
The front seats are large and supportive, with bolsters that can be electronically adjusted to cocoon you, while you treat yourself to 8 different massage settings of varying intensity. The capacitive touchscreen allows you to control the in-seat ventilation and heating functions as well. We believe the ventilated and massage options should not be skipped from the optional-equipment list and it ought to be specified, especially if the car is going to be self-driven 80% of the time. However, if you intend on being chauffeured around in the e-tron, the massage seats may be skipped.
The rear seats are reasonably spacious. While taller passengers will notice the higher floors, the average adult will not struggle to get comfortable in the back. Taller passengers may complain about the lack of adequate under-thigh support at the back, further accentuated by the high floor. There is just about enough headroom for taller passengers in the Sportback variant. However, there is no issue whatsoever in the SUV variant.
4-zone climate control should keep A/C-related arguments between passengers to a minimum, one would hope. It even comes with an in-built air-ionizer and aromatization function, in the unfortunate event the ambience is disturbed after a heavy lunch.
The expansive panoramic sunroof allows plenty of light into the cabin when the blinds are retracted at the touch of a button.
While our e-tron SUV test car was specced with dual-tone black and tan interiors including tan leather upholstery and matching door cards, the Sportback that drove was specified with all-black interiors.
The Q8 E-trons in-car entertainment is taken care of, courtesy of a 705W Bang & Olufsen 3D sound system, supported by 16 speakers and a 15-channel amplifier. The stereo offers an incredible audio experience, especially if tuned well. Sadly, the B&O system does not have the trick tweeters that rise out of the dashboard found in some other premium Audis.
Clean and thoughtfully designed dashboard. Switchgear and controls fall to hand easily.
Tweeters are recessed into the A-pillar. We wish Audi would have equipped the B&O system with the tweeters that rise out of the dash on start up. A missed opportunity in our opinion.
Perfectly sized steering wheel with classy aluminium inlays.
Virtual cockpit is a dream to use with great clarity and superb detailing. It also shows you regen during braking and additional boost when activated using a boot-full of throttle.
Level of regeneration can be adjusted using aluminium-finished paddles on the steering wheel. While pulling the one on the left increases the level, the one on the right can be used to decrease it.

Using this lever, folding the rear seats requires minimal effort. Useful hooks have been provided to secure your shopping bags in place.

Driving the Q8 e-tron
Thumb the starter whilst keeping the brake pedal depressed and you will be greeted by an uncharacteristic "whir" from the electric motor rated at 300 kW backed by a (now-larger) 114 kWh battery pack.  For reference, the outgoing e-tron was equipped with a smaller 95 kWh battery pack. This, along with the now improved drag-coefficient values of the Q8 e-tron, has resulted in an overall improvement of the car’s range by 32% as claimed by Audi. The SUV and Sportback variants can now do 582 km and 600 km on a full charge in ideal circumstances.
For those who want plain and simple numbers, the motor delivers a claimed 408 BHP and is capable of hitting the century mark (100 km/h) from a standstill (0 km/h) in about 5.7 seconds. Audi claims that the Sportback variant can achieve the same target slightly quicker than the SUV, i.e. in 5.6 seconds.
Ease off the brake pedal and the car remains stationary. There is no creep function in this car. Dab the throttle pedal and the car gets going in a smooth and controlled manner. One thing that strikes you about this car, as it gets going, is just how smooth, silent and refined the drivetrain is. Vibrations are nearly non-existent, and the power delivery is linear and progressive.
Give it a boot-full however, and the car catapults you forward with the sort of ferocity that very few ICE-powered cars could. People who talk about ICE-powered cars delivering instant torque with no turbo lag should experience the Q8 e-tron to truly understand the meaning of "instant torque" and "no lag".
The feeling is akin to what one would experience in a passenger airliner, just as the aircraft is done with its taxiing procedures and the pilot engages maximum thrust. It truly pins you to the back of your seat and sends you down the road, sans the drama you may expect from an ICE-powered sportscar.
If the battery pack and the electric motor are up to the task, i.e. well charged and reasonably cool in terms of battery-pack temperatures, the car will allow you to tap into its reserves and give you maximum boost when the throttle is pinned to the floor. The sensation that maximum boost provides is so ferocious and severe that you begin to wonder why you need that elusive sportscar/supercar that’s on your bucket list.
And then you are reminded about the drama, or rather the lack thereof, that the electric motor fails to deliver. This is where the EV drivetrain is often found lacking – the drama that an ICE-powered car delivers, in the form of varied levels of power delivery and of course, a characterful exhaust note accompanying the ferocity of the motor. It may seem irrelevant to those who crave outright power and performance, and while we certainly see the appeal in quiet performance that the Q8 e-tron delivers in spades, we are after all automobile enthusiasts deep down and at heart. And to us, the appeal wears off quickly and we are left wanting some drama and character from the Q8 e-tron.
This brings us to a quote from the internet that we must mention: Comparing the performance of an electric car to that of an ICE-powered car is like comparing the performance and efficiency of a microwave to that of a barbeque grill. The microwave may cook food faster and more efficiently, but have you ever heard of someone inviting you over to join them for a microwave party?

Suspension
If there was one aspect of the Q8 e-tron that blew us away, it is the ride, handling and braking. It is perhaps one of the most dynamically accomplished cars we have driven.
For starters, the steering is quite un-Audi-like as it delivers plenty of feel and feedback, even if it’s artificial. The calibration work undertaken to set it up could not have been done better, all things considered. The car turns in sharply and does not feel lazy or dead off-center – something Audis have been rather guilty of lately. It is very quick and direct, making it perfect for a spot of hustling on your favourite B-road.
The steering is complemented perfectly by the car’s adaptive air suspension that can be set up using 7 drive modes: Dynamic, Efficiency, All-Road, Off-Road, Auto, Comfort, and Individual.
Engaging Dynamic mode via the touchscreen on the dashboard drops the car down from its standard ride height of about 175 mm to its lowest possible ride height (149 mm). It also firms up the ride without making it too stiff. The car feels predictably pointy and tighter in Dynamic mode. Efficiency mode raises the ride height a touch from its lowest setting but still keeps it lower than the standard ride height. All-Road mode raises the ride height by about 35 mm from the standard, allowing for easier traversal of rough roads. Off-Road mode raises it by an additional 35 mm over All-Road mode, giving the Q8 e-tron enough ground clearance to tackle tough trails and tricky courses, should the need arise. Auto mode allows the onboard electronic suspension platform to work with the 4 level sensors on the car’s axle in order to adapt and optimize the ride height as well as its general characteristics based on prevailing road conditions. Comfort mode softens up the ride a great deal, while Individual mode allows the driver to make adjustments and set up the ride exactly the way he would want it.
In Dynamic, Off-Road and Auto modes, the drivetrain sends power and torque to all four wheels a.k.a. Quattro! However, in the standard driving modes the drivetrain sends power only to the rear wheels – which makes the Q8 e-tron possibly the first RWD Audi since the R8 supercar!
That said, the front axle will automatically receive power and torque when the onboard computers deem it necessary. Variable torque distribution helps regulate torque split between individual wheels and axles, based on road conditions and driving situations. Selective wheel torque intervention via the brakes helps control the amount of torque being sent to individual wheels, further aiding the car’s handling and allowing it to rotate around the corner harder and quicker!
The car’s adaptive air suspension is more than just a trick though. It offers a near-magic carpet-like ride quality. No matter how bad or good the road seems to be, the suspension allows the car to breathe with the road surface and absorb all the ruts, potholes and undulations without breaking a sweat. Even in Dynamic mode, the car simply sailed over all the rough stuff, while in Comfort mode, it dismissed potholes and ruts like they did not exist!
With such an accomplished ride, one would assume that the handling would be compromised. However, the manner in which the car negotiated corners and bends left us amazed. It truly does feel like it’s on rails! Nothing seemed to unsettle the car, and we threw everything at it! While you do feel the heft of the car around a fast corner, the chassis of the car gives its driver the feeling of being shrink-wrapped. It’s relatively easy for even novice drivers to negotiate fast corners.
All this of course comes at a price. Long-term reliability and maintenance of the adaptive air suspension is a bit of a question mark. Replacement kits are certainly not going to be cheap, and while the suspension may be robust enough to deal with everyday driving, Indian roads can pose a serious challenge. Therefore, long-term reliability remains to be seen.
Braking performance also took us by surprise. It is amazing how the brake pedal offers so much feedback and feel, despite all the tech tied to it. We had a couple of moments where we expected to fly over unmarked speed-breakers that we had failed to spot in time, but a firm push on the brake pedal is all it needed to bring it down to crawling speeds. A visual inspection of the brake discs and callipers led us to believe that the braking system was potentially taken from one of the hot Audi ‘S’ or ‘RS’ variants.

Safety & Technology
The Q8 e-tron is loaded to the gills with trick safety features and technology, to the point where you begin to question your involvement as a driver behind its steering wheel.
Our experience driving this car was limited to the road network in and around Nandi Hills and on open stretches of highway. Rarely did we chance upon bumper-to-bumper traffic. But in our limited time driving the Q8 e-tron on B-roads, we understood quickly that the car could easily drive itself. Single-pedal driving can easily get you around. As you approach traffic, coasting at speed, the car reads the distance between itself and the vehicles in front of it and controls its speed by applying the brakes ever so slightly while simultaneously drawing energy from it through the regeneration system.
Being an EV, you can expect the car to have the technology to recuperate lost energy whilst braking through its regeneration technology. While coasting, there is no regeneration whatsoever. However, using the brake pedal with various levels of intensity will help recover lost energy and further builds on the range left in the tank. Alternatively, one can use the left paddle on the steering to mimic engine braking and further coax the car into recuperating lost energy.
The lane-departure warning / assist is one such feature, that tugs the steering and nudges the car back into its lane the moment it notices you driving over the white lane markers. It’s a clever piece of technology but can be annoying when trying to needle your way through slow-moving highway traffic. One way to game it, without turning it off altogether, is to use the indicators liberally, and the system will not intervene.
The Q8 e-tron gets 8 airbags, which, we're pretty certain nobody would want to find out how well they probably work.
The car’s headlights do a neat little party trick by projecting the Audi logo along with a cool e-tron motif onto a wall or any surface you choose to project it on. Sadly, we could not test this out as our drive was during the day.
Along with the car, Audi offers a phone application for Apple and Android users, that its owners can download and monitor the car’s driving remotely. In essence, you could hand the car over to your driver or friend, and you would be notified immediately the moment either of them accelerates, brakes or turns hard! There is no escaping bad behaviour in this car’s driver’s seat, that’s for sure! The app also provides its user with the live location of the car, and a "car finder" in case you don’t remember where you’ve parked it during a mall visit. Charge / range details, concierge services and access to Audi’s rewards club are also offered through the phone application.
In a bid to allow customers a variety of specifications and options to choose from, Audi now offers 48 exterior colour options, 8 interior leather options that can be paired with 11 stitching colour options, two wooden inlay designs and 2 comprehensive exclusive leather packages. This should help set your Q8 e-tron apart from your neighbour's.

Q8 e-tron Sportback.
Audi offers the Q8 e-tron in two body styles. The SUV to the right and the Sportback to the left.
In terms of hardware, drivetrain and underpinnings, the SUV and Sportback are identical cars. However, during the press presentation, we noticed in one of the slides that Audi rated the Sportback's range (WLTP) at 600 km, while the SUV had a slightly lower range rating of 582 km. Upon enquiry, we were informed that the Sportback may achieve a slightly superior range owing to its fastback styling and lower drag coefficient value of 0.24 Cd compared to the SUV's drag-coefficient rating of 0.27 Cd.
The Sportback can be striking especially in the right colours. Personally, we prefer the clean and proportionate styling of the SUV variant. Polarizing styling aside, the Sportback's design that has the potential to grow on you.
Our first glimpse of it reminded us of some of the weird coupe-fied SUVs like the BMW X4 and the Mercedes GLC 43 AMG. In fact, there is more than a hint of Ford Mustang Mach-E in the Sportback’s styling. It will surely divide opinions amongst the more traditional folk who prefer a conventional design.
The idea of a car that looks like an SUV from the waist down and a coupe from the waist up just does not sit well with some of us. The swooping coupe-like roofline and fastback-esque rake of the rear windscreen and tailgate aren’t design elements that I would like to see on an SUV.
It wouldn't be wrong to assume that headroom in the rear seat of the Sportback is compromised owing to the swooping coupe-like roofline. It is a bit tighter, undeniably, when compared to the SUV. However, it is adequate even for taller passengers.
The Sportback looks particularly smashing in black.
Sportback logos on the B-pillars. No logos anywhere else.
The Sportback can look good if specced from the factory with the right exterior options – such as Audi’s "black pack" featured here on the red car.
With the air suspension raised to its maximum setting, it’s got more than just a passing resemblance to a Martian rover from a Hollywood sci-fi film, especially when photographed on rough and rocky terrain.
Pictured here is the Sportback lowered to its normal ride-height setting.

Double dose of aggression when viewed head-on! The money shot, if there ever was one.
