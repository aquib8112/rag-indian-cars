Its touch-type controls can be unintuitive, including the non-user-friendly touch-based ORVM adjustment, and it has ergonomic issues like an A-pillar blind spot, poor rearward visibility, and inconvenient button placement. It misses features such as rear-wheel steering, rear sunshade, grab handles for rear passengers, a full-size spare tyre (it only has a space saver), and a front trunk (frunk). The spare tyre is placed above the boot floor, compromising luggage space. Additionally, the rear seat is best suited for two adults and a child, not three adults."}, "metadata": {"source": "reviews"}}
{"inputs": {"question": "What are the different driving modes available in the Tata Nexon EV and how do they differ?"}, "outputs": {"answer": "The Tata Nexon EV offers three driving modes, each tailored for different driving styles. 'City Mode' is the default setting and activates every time the car starts; it strikes a balance between power and efficiency, suitable for both city and highway driving. 'Eco Mode' maximizes range by dulling throttle response, making for a smoother city drive, though it may feel underpowered during quick overtaking. 'Sport Mode' offers the most aggressive performance with sharper throttle response and quicker acceleration, ideal for fun expressway runs, but it can feel too peaky for city use and drains the battery faster."}, "metadata": {"source": "reviews"}}
{"inputs": {"question": "What is City Mode in the Tata Nexon EV and how does it perform?"}, "outputs": {"answer": "City Mode is the default driving mode in the Tata Nexon EV and the car always restarts in this mode regardless of the previously used mode.
